The Destruction of Cultural Landscapes by Open cast Lignite Mining in Lower Lusatia
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2f8IrU04W4
thank you very much for the kind
00:02
introduction welcome to cut loose and
00:04
pity you I hope you enjoyed your
00:07
workshop or seminar winter school
00:10
however is called so far I heard that
00:14
unfortunately the excursion yesterday
00:16
was cancelled due to demonstration but I
00:21
hope that some of the pictures can show
00:25
you what you have missed so my topic is
00:30
about the cultural landscape that we
00:36
find in the area of these opencast mines
00:39
and what you see here is a picture of
00:46
the opencast mine in valdaire and if you
00:49
have a break that you go down this floor
00:51
and you have a view you will see exactly
00:54
these yeah yeah this is the power plant
01:04
in quality and you can see it from here
01:06
yeah and this is the opencast mine so we
01:09
cannot make it a little bit darker
01:15
better for this for the slides okay i
01:20
will show you more or details of these
01:23
technique and but this okay this is a
01:28
quite nice picture showing you the
01:32
situation here north of caucus yeah
01:35
things just completely down completely
01:39
not good better
01:49
ok this is the conveyor bridge which is
01:52
a quite unique technique developed here
01:55
analyzation I will talk about that later
01:56
on too so the outline of my presentation
02:00
is listed here as mentioned my chair
02:06
scott gb geology and landscape
02:08
development of our talk a little bit but
02:09
what we are doing and then i'll give you
02:12
an introduction and the natural setting
02:14
and then i will focus on some aspects of
02:19
archeological findings here and then
02:21
show you what this is all about for our
02:26
future research i can send you a lot of
02:31
papers research papers journal papers
02:35
PDFs that will give you more information
02:40
about my talk and where you can have the
02:43
primary source for this just send me an
02:46
email or I will give it to to the chair
02:49
here and then he can distribute it so
02:53
the the research we are doing is an
02:58
integrative research which means that we
03:01
are standing the geomorphology which is
03:05
the land form of our surface we are also
03:09
studying the pd ology so the source of
03:12
our earth and within the topography and
03:19
the source there are two other aspects
03:22
the one is the archaeological context
03:25
meanings of what imprint as we find from
03:28
the human land use for example or from
03:32
humans in general and the other aspect
03:35
is what does this mean for ecosystem
03:41
meta fluxes energy fluxes something like
03:44
that so how does geomorphology and
03:49
pathology contribute to aspects of geo
03:52
ecology so to say we worked quite a lot
03:59
in the field
04:01
means when we when I talk we work in the
04:03
field is that our students take a car
04:08
take a shovel take these equipments as
04:11
you see it here make drillings or just
04:16
manually dig out the soil profiles so
04:20
once they did it they can have a rest or
04:24
we use heavy machines for doing large
04:29
excavations and this is very special
04:31
here in the area because we have a
04:33
really large excavation which is the
04:35
opencast mine and that makes it very
04:36
very unique here for doing our research
04:39
so by this field approach we get insight
04:44
into the quaternary stratigraphy so the
04:48
stratigraphy of the last two million
04:50
years and how the sediments develop and
04:54
how the sauce develop and we reconstruct
04:56
landscape development by that sits
04:59
that's what we call landscape
05:01
development so you may have a different
05:03
approach on on the definition of
05:05
landscape so my understanding of
05:08
landscape its is that this is some kind
05:12
of an ecosystem in an area that is
05:16
controlled by several factors like
05:18
climate saw topography but also by
05:21
humans so and then we call it a cultural
05:23
landscape when it's affected by human
05:26
and this impact can what is human effect
05:29
is not only a recent one but we can have
05:34
influenced or changes of our ecosystem
05:37
and our landscapes seven thousand years
05:39
old with the start of early farming by
05:43
the Neolithic people we have the
05:46
formation of the first cultural
05:48
landscape so this is my understanding of
05:51
a landscape and the difference between a
05:54
natural landscape in a cultural
05:55
landscape we use several techniques I
05:59
don't go into detail into this Yeti's
06:02
electrical resistivity tomography or
06:04
SSRS shallow seismic refraction GPRS
06:08
ground-penetrating radar and all these
06:12
techniques are used
06:13
to we call it an indirect technique to
06:19
identify structures or the architecture
06:23
of the shallow subsurface shallow
06:26
subsurface is a term we use in
06:28
geomorphology to describe 5 10 meters
06:34
below the surface so we are not like
06:38
geologists so geophysics interested in
06:41
the earth crust and the inner core
06:42
something like that we want to study the
06:46
first meters or sometimes tens of meters
06:49
where the soils are and we're young
06:51
sediments are deposited so the one
06:59
aspect is to study the subsurface by our
07:05
best buy our outcrops because what we
07:08
see we can sample the larger the outcrop
07:12
the better is if we don't have these
07:16
outcrops we use these geophysical
07:18
techniques as you seen before and the
07:22
other point is that we want to get a
07:25
very detailed information on the
07:28
topography meaning that we want to get
07:33
digital elevation models DMS and this is
07:37
done by surveying techniques one
07:40
surveying technique is a terrestrial
07:41
lighter so that's light detection and
07:44
range it's like a laser scanner it scans
07:47
the topography some of you may know it
07:50
from architecture something like that
07:52
you can also scan buildings we scan our
07:55
gym apologia and what we also use is
08:00
these micro or these micro drones or
08:04
UAVs as they are called and we use quite
08:10
sophisticated one
08:12
that can produce digital elevation
08:15
models by photogrammetry so by that the
08:20
drone has a camera and then by
08:24
photogrammetry you can produce very good
08:28
digital elevation models so we have
08:30
information on the subsurface we have
08:33
information on the topography and then
08:35
we we are studying what is in the
08:38
structure in the soil and a sediment and
08:41
there's a whole variety of lab
08:44
techniques i will show you later on what
08:47
is specially done by us is the feed
08:50
portable approach meaning that we can
08:53
take devices as you see you here and
08:55
take these devices into the field and do
08:58
analysis on site now so feed probably
09:02
the portable near-infrared feed portable
09:05
x-ray fluorescence and feed portable
09:07
x-ray diffraction especially the that
09:10
one is quite common also used in
09:12
archaeology to determine metal content
09:17
or metal concentration in artifacts for
09:20
example sometimes you can produce
09:22
fingerprints of the of the of the
09:27
artifacts and x-ray diffraction you can
09:30
identify minerals this is quite unique
09:33
because this technique is really used in
09:36
the field it's very rough so it's not so
09:40
the detection limits are not so good as
09:44
in for a for lab analysis but for
09:46
example we use these feed potable XRF to
09:51
determine metal contaminations deriving
09:58
from historic mining air pollution so
10:05
for example in the 15th century we had a
10:07
lot of mining in Central Europe you may
10:12
know the one the Heritage Site in the
10:14
hearts Martin's here and in the
10:16
surrounding of this
10:18
a metal mining there was a crushing of
10:23
the euros and by that distribution of
10:25
the wars and losses are rich in heavy
10:27
metals and the heavy metals then
10:30
accumulate for example in river
10:32
sediments yeah we hate for example we
10:34
had a study where we identified a metal
10:39
contamination a lead contamination in a
10:42
lluvia floodplain with amounts of 20,000
10:47
parts per million so you can guess what
10:51
is the upper limit which is allowed in
10:54
Germany so that's 1,200 parts per
10:58
million let if you have 1,200 possible
11:02
and let or more you have to yeah just
11:06
clean this side up and we have sites in
11:10
Germany that had have contaminations
11:13
that 400 years old and they have stole
11:18
these high amounts so these are
11:20
techniques we use for studying the past
11:26
environment so to say a lot of lab
11:29
analysis i don't i think i will skip
11:32
this a lot of salt physics to determine
11:37
the texture the grain size the physical
11:39
properties etc which is important to
11:42
understand yet how does our sole
11:45
function so incensed that's the soul or
11:49
is the soil able to hold lots of water
11:53
for the plants we call this water
11:55
retention or in a sandy soil you have a
11:58
drainage of of the water and the soil is
12:01
not able to hold a lot of water against
12:04
gravity and therefore this site simply
12:07
is not very well suited for farming
12:09
where's the other side is better suited
12:12
for farming so this is there's a lot of
12:14
analysis chemical and physical analysis
12:16
which is necessary for us to understand
12:19
soil in sense of a function for land use
12:23
or crop production so there are
12:25
different functions of soil one is land
12:27
use and other chemical analysis like pH
12:32
might know it's an easy one or carbon
12:34
content several chemical parameters are
12:38
important to understand the soil as it
12:43
is for our interpretation on the land
12:47
use so some pictures and names you see
12:51
years or of course we do this in a group
12:53
we have several PhD students working
12:56
technician postdoc researchers so this
12:59
is it's just the part of my group
13:02
working on g archeology so my group is
13:06
about 12 people so most of them work
13:10
more or less in the geology pod the the
13:15
the funding we have for this research is
13:19
mainly from the German Research
13:22
Foundation and we have a big project
13:25
which is called virtual Institute for
13:28
integrated climate and landscape
13:30
evolution analysis this is funded by the
13:32
helmholtz association and we cooperate
13:36
with gchat in potsdam and the polish
13:40
academia of science I will tell you some
13:44
approaches and recites of these projects
13:47
and now so coming to the second part
13:51
giving you an introduction to what you
13:54
missed yesterday and where you are as we
13:59
are here in in Germany of course but
14:04
nearby the Polish border we so from a
14:12
joke from the geography geography we
14:16
have these unit in the south which we
14:20
call low mountain ranges and then we
14:23
have this area which has very low
14:26
elevations and therefore it's called
14:28
Northern European all and elevations of
14:30
150 maximum 200 meters above sea level
14:33
and God post is located here in this
14:38
part of the Northern European lowland we
14:42
are mainly find quarterly glacial
14:44
deposits and I would tell you
14:46
in a minute what this means so looking
14:49
at the sores and the topography you see
14:52
a block diagram here so this is
14:55
pose but it would be up here so this is
14:57
the free right did you make the question
14:59
this reward oh yeah okay so you know
15:03
this and you see three or four distinct
15:11
geomorphic unit units so in the northern
15:14
part we have an upland so to say which
15:19
is of glacial origins is the white
15:22
sealian part so we're talking about the
15:25
quaternary we had this as I said it's
15:28
the last two mil in a million years we
15:31
have fluctuation of warm periods and
15:33
cold periods and the last cold period is
15:35
called the white sealian glaciation or
15:37
the waxy lien code stage or oxygen cold
15:42
period and this period of cold
15:48
temperatures led to increase off of
15:52
glaciers and the southern limit of the
15:57
white ceiling glacier about eight
15:59
thousand twenty thousand years before
16:01
was situated here so this was the
16:04
southern rim of this huge Fenno scandic
16:08
ice sheet and at the rim there was out
16:13
wash from the glacier which is called
16:17
the sander and then we have these huge
16:21
rallies which we call which Toronto are
16:24
that's also a term we use in English or
16:26
ice marginal Valley so the huge masses
16:30
of water are then transported towards
16:34
the North Sea yeah along these you
16:38
jealous and in the southern part there
16:41
other glacially posit but these are
16:44
older one so these are else terrain or
16:48
salient a glaciation so like sealian is
16:54
the last glaciation and a stencil ian
16:56
are older glaciation
16:58
so these is 120,000 130,000 uspp and
17:02
what's this what's the diagram also
17:04
shows is that there according to these
17:07
geomorphic units we have a distribution
17:09
of typical source like the pot saw in
17:13
sandy areas or the canvas oil which is a
17:16
brown on the uplands the other part is
17:20
that you see these lignite minds because
17:24
under these quarterly deposits in the
17:28
tertiary layers you find a lot of these
17:32
brown color what we call it lik night
17:37
this is a detail of the area here you
17:41
see coppice north east is young valley
17:47
the lignite mine thus provide again the
17:52
southern part wait so it's the other
17:54
lignite mine and if we zoom in you see
17:56
different aspects of the geomorphology
17:59
it's not so important here ok some facts
18:03
about the lignite mining Germany also we
18:07
are talking about a reduction of co2 is
18:11
number one in lignite producing
18:13
countries before China before Russia
18:16
before Canada so Germany is number one
18:19
lichna producing conduced we still
18:22
produce 25 percent of our energy or
18:24
power from lignite they are several
18:28
three
18:32
mining district Germany that's the
18:35
Rhineland and your bike alone born artin
18:39
then in your biologic in middle germany
18:42
and in east germany in lusatia we have
18:45
another one and loose asia is the second
18:48
largest district in Germany there is a
18:52
huge demand on land so just discuss this
18:55
the entire area affected by the mining
19:01
is more than 2,000 square kilometers and
19:05
this area is defined by the groundwater
19:10
lower ring so this is an opencast mining
19:13
and opencast mining means that if you
19:16
want to get to the ore from the surface
19:19
you need to lower the ground water
19:22
because the natural ground water
19:23
situation here is that the ground would
19:25
would be two three or four five meters
19:28
above about that below the surface but
19:32
the the lignite seam is sometimes 18
19:35
meters below surface so you have to pump
19:38
out all the border and by pumping out
19:40
the water you produce these huge
19:42
lowering of the groundwater so more than
19:46
2,000 square kilometers of groundwater
19:49
lowering and 850 square kilometers of
19:54
active of land demand by by the mining
19:58
itself you see these is Berlin again
20:02
prevailed then cut pues bien shraddha
20:06
kapoor snort and the southern parts all
20:09
these areas are my former mines and you
20:14
may know that the gdr we lied on almost
20:16
one hundred percent on lignite for
20:18
producing power so before the show
20:21
before the german reunification they
20:22
were more than 25 of these mines and now
20:25
we have five actually we have four
20:29
because cop was not was closed some
20:30
weeks ago now the technique we are using
20:34
here in this asia is a so-called strip
20:38
mining technique this is
20:41
very special in that sense that we use a
20:45
so-called conveyor bridge and the
20:48
conveyor bridge which is used to union
20:51
rally is called f60 f60 stance is for
20:56
the capacity to transport 60 metres of
21:01
overburden from one side to the other
21:04
side with one process that's what the
21:07
conveyor conveyor bridge does not
21:09
excavate the lignite the conveyor bridge
21:12
simply transports the material from the
21:19
four field to the reclamation side and
21:24
it has a maximum capacity of 60 metres
21:28
so the lignite seem the interval is in
21:32
the depth of about 80 metres something
21:34
like that so smaller excavators have to
21:40
dig out the material in the four field
21:44
until or if to a point where there's 60
21:50
meters left and then the conveyor bridge
21:52
transports the overburden from this side
21:55
to the hip side and then by that process
21:59
the lignite is opened and the excavators
22:04
transport this to the power plant which
22:07
is near by and this is an important
22:10
point also from the economic you fifty
22:14
percent of the lignite is water so
22:18
economically it does not make sense to
22:20
transport the lignite for distances so
22:22
the power plant always have to be close
22:24
to the to the to the mine and it's a
22:30
it's a quite simple technique but it's a
22:33
huge technique so this machine has the
22:36
heat of the Eiffel Tower in Paris yeah
22:42
and we work in this area and the other
22:45
guys who do was reclamation work in that
22:48
area this is one of the two slides we
22:51
join German but do I explain this
22:53
so it's just a really recent publication
22:57
we made for a conference never show it
22:59
so you see that the strategy in sense of
23:02
the soils here now you have the active
23:05
did not mind the conveyor bridge you
23:08
have the spreader which dumps material
23:12
from which is transported from the four
23:14
feet to the reclamation side and then
23:16
here in that area on the post meaning
23:19
post mining site new soils develop very
23:22
young sauce and in the four field you
23:25
have older size which are destroyed and
23:28
that's the part where you talk about
23:30
here the destruction of the landscape in
23:33
the four field and my story is that
23:37
there are not only soils like the brown
23:41
ones which developed in the last twenty
23:43
thousand years by natural so develop a
23:46
doe genetic processes but they are also
23:49
relatively young sauce as a result of
23:54
early human impact and and therefore we
23:59
see or we can identify some kind of a
24:04
cultural landscape in the four field of
24:07
of this mind this is an area of view of
24:13
the lignin man inshallah desocupes would
24:15
be down here so this is corpus not the
24:19
smaller mind this is a which is close
24:22
now this is the mind young spider this
24:25
is the strip which opened the lignite
24:29
and you see this is the reclamation area
24:31
and in general we call it re cultivation
24:34
because we have a cultivation before
24:37
since in the land use of farming and we
24:40
want to establish a cultivation
24:41
afterwards farming or forestry if we go
24:44
to North America they call it
24:46
reclamation Peoria narration because
24:50
often you affect the landscape which was
24:53
not where there is no and anthropogenic
24:58
used before so in the four field the
25:04
the area is prepared for the mining so
25:07
there's a forest here in this example
25:09
the forest is cleared and then all the
25:14
area is mine and then Dumpty on this
25:17
side and this is the area where we work
25:19
and this is the power plant that this is
25:22
pipes with the ponds here so the
25:27
strategy of the of the mining is the
25:30
strip would be here in the south is
25:31
again enjoy today so the the mind
25:34
operates in this case from south to
25:36
north and with a velocity of about 500
25:40
meters per year on the width with can be
25:44
up to five kilometers so every year good
25:47
area of 500 meters depth and five levels
25:53
with is destroyed and the the bright
25:59
colors you see here in the four feet are
26:02
all our archaeological excavations which
26:06
is an obligation by law in Germany that
26:10
once you have some kind of Autobahn or
26:15
these huge excavations also small huge
26:19
mining operations are also smaller ones
26:22
you have to to check is there some kind
26:25
of archaeological remain in this in the
26:28
subsurface or in the area and this has
26:31
to be paid by this case rotten file so
26:35
what if you buy in the area in Germany
26:37
and you are unlucky so to see and you
26:40
find some archaeology remain you have to
26:42
pay for for the rescue of this remain or
26:45
at least for the surveying and the
26:53
recording of the of the findings so and
26:56
this is done by the state Archaeological
26:59
Survey the state archaeological server
27:00
operates with 15 to 20 people every day
27:03
in the four field technicians all kind
27:07
of professions and document all the
27:10
findings here because
27:15
after six months the whole area is gone
27:18
forever so it's destroyed what what they
27:22
do is they simply document it yeah and
27:26
this is what is interesting for us with
27:30
the profession we have and I will tell
27:33
you some examples of the findings of the
27:38
last years just to show you the the idea
27:43
of this research and the studies quite
27:49
interesting approach was the excavation
27:55
of an indian lake basin so the immune is
28:00
the last interglacial interglacial 110
28:03
thousand years for something like that
28:06
where we had similar climatic conditions
28:10
like today and in a lake basin you
28:18
sometimes find remains of if you're
28:23
lucky of humans yeah but at least of
28:29
plants yeah yeah shovel of elk or moose
28:34
and I guess we will find see some more
28:39
spectacular pictures from my colleague
28:42
later on to make it short here the the
28:48
special aspect of this research was that
28:51
it was done directly in the mine not in
28:54
the flow field but in the mind which is
28:56
quite unique so normally that they don't
28:59
do that because this is really the area
29:02
where we have the heavy machinery in
29:04
operation and it can be very dangerous
29:06
so it needs some some planning to do
29:12
that yeah but there was not a human
29:17
finding so the big funding is
29:22
still in mesle okay some another aspect
29:28
is the shop at this picture and here you
29:35
ideally see the this concept of what we
29:38
call the GOP dolla G because what you
29:42
see is the topography or the
29:46
geomorphology so the landform so this
29:51
land phone is a dune so it was formed by
29:56
windblown processes or by wind blown or
30:00
by eat olean dynamics as we call it so
30:04
this is the olean sand and it forms this
30:08
duel so we have the substrate or the
30:13
subsurface and we have the land form but
30:16
the interesting part here is the black
30:19
the white and the red colors which is a
30:22
soil so the soil is embedded in this
30:28
land form and in this substrate that
30:36
builds up the land form and bi analytics
30:41
as I described by dating techniques we
30:45
can identify ok how old is this soil
30:50
here how old is the eolian cover of the
30:54
area etc and and this is the approach we
30:58
say ok we can reconstruct the landscape
31:03
development in this case we can
31:06
reconstruct ok this part lower part here
31:10
is characterized by just natural
31:17
dynamics and this is the natural soil
31:20
which called the Holocene saw the so
31:23
development of the last 10,000 years and
31:25
then later on either by human activity
31:30
or by natural processes
31:34
there's an oriental position of younger
31:37
material and on top there is a very
31:41
shallow soil so a young soil as I showed
31:44
you before another example very nice one
31:51
giving us evidence of direct evidence of
31:55
the early farming so in the field you
32:01
sometimes see these kind of structures
32:03
which are not really good to photograph
32:09
or to make picture of it so this is a
32:12
so-called rich and furrow system written
32:15
for our systems you see a picture here
32:18
much better with the this linear
32:22
structure so this is a forest this is
32:25
farmland at a recent farmlands
32:28
discovered by by trees and under the
32:33
forest canopy you see these linear
32:35
structures and these linear structures
32:37
on these rich and furrows which are
32:42
produced by a special plowing technique
32:48
and the ploughing technique was that
32:51
manner that the the farmer used will use
32:57
this plowed chest in this direction and
33:00
then he turned and moved that direction
33:04
and then he turned again and something
33:05
like that so with this technique he
33:10
built up a little elevation here and a
33:17
ditch this side and so the structure
33:23
basically mirrors the former size of the
33:31
farmland the the former used so these
33:36
rich and further systems are often found
33:40
in
33:41
in our area another evidence for early
33:46
agriculture are these structures in the
33:52
sand caused by this hook plow and the
33:59
supply could be dated with Dendra age to
34:03
about 1000 years before this is the
34:06
Slovak period here in the area so this
34:09
is an archaeological excavation by the
34:13
archeological finding of these ploughing
34:16
structures and the dating we know that
34:18
thousand years before there was farming
34:21
in the area using the source and
34:25
producing this structure and with
34:30
farming in an area where we have very
34:34
dry conditions where you have a lot of
34:37
sand where there is high wind speed we
34:42
have the effect of soil erosion of wind
34:46
erosion as we can see nowadays for
34:50
example this picture was taking some
34:52
years ago and it's not a gravel road
34:56
it's a paved road yeah but it's
34:59
completely covered with sand so also the
35:02
ditches here are completely covered with
35:04
sand meaning that from the adjacent
35:07
farming land the sand was blown over the
35:11
area like you see here over the
35:13
landscape and just destroyed the
35:17
vegetation the smaller ones and produce
35:20
these olean sediments as we have seen in
35:23
other outcrops air as in in a section of
35:28
the last thousand years I one finding I
35:34
want to explain a little bit more detail
35:37
is also in the intruder so you see this
35:41
is the year march two thousand eight
35:44
april 2010 june
35:47
11 and then so these areas already gone
35:51
and we had a short profile here in that
35:54
area in this glacial outwash or in
35:58
display this washroom tiles ice marginal
36:00
Valley and we see in the section the
36:03
plowing mark so we know that was
36:05
agriculture and this is the profile with
36:09
the horizon here this dark one so this
36:13
is the former power horizon which is a
36:16
top view this is the section in the
36:19
profile and on top of these plowing
36:23
arise we have this brighter material
36:26
which is an Aeolian sediment so by
36:28
dating this plowing horizon to these
36:31
ages about 1,000 years before we know
36:35
that there was plowing in the area once
36:37
I was used before and then afterwards
36:39
and ohlen sedimentation with sand so we
36:44
can reconstruct the landscape that we
36:46
know that there was some farming but
36:48
then the farming yeah was dismissed so
36:52
gone and later on we have destruction of
36:56
our farming land by Aeolian
36:59
sedimentation I know how much time okay
37:08
last part is the focus on chocolate
37:10
production chaco was the energy source
37:15
till the end at the mid of the 19th
37:18
century something like that before the
37:20
use of hardcore so for any mining and
37:23
for any production of ores of melting
37:26
you needed charcoal so chocolate was
37:28
produced by the forests and you see some
37:33
pictures from from archives but also in
37:37
the 60s from different eras these urban
37:40
from lusatia area so it took the wood
37:44
and produced in these charcoal kilns the
37:49
charcoal for the
37:51
the Iron Works to to smell the iron and
37:55
produce yeah guns of the guns like the
37:59
Swedish lot of guns and to have weapons
38:05
for the war and in in our our area in
38:14
the inshallah we found a lot of these
38:15
remains here you see this this circus
38:19
there's one there's another one and
38:21
these circles are remains of the
38:23
charcoal pens because what they did they
38:25
produce these piles of wood and they
38:28
made the charcoal took 10 14 days and
38:31
then they just harvested the charcoal
38:33
and then it was transported to the
38:36
linear by ironwork word was used in the
38:41
ovens to smoke the iron and in the
38:44
landscape remain these circles because
38:48
this is a ditch which was produced in
38:51
surrounding the ironwork so these were
38:53
circular charcoal cancer if you are
38:56
lucky you'll find remains of the
38:59
charcoal here the archaeologists did a
39:02
lot of surveying and classified these
39:08
these chocolate comes according to the
39:11
ground planes so we have runs very
39:13
simple ones then some containing posts
39:18
others with pits outside then multiple
39:23
ones I showed you or even ones with pry
39:26
marks so what we do now since several
39:31
years we want to get a better idea of
39:34
what this means for the landscape the
39:37
landscape development and the
39:40
interaction of humans with natural and
39:43
the cultural landscape and so this is a
39:45
long-term project we established some
39:48
years ago so we have several aims you
39:51
see here but I just explained the first
39:54
parts to study the spatial dimension of
39:58
the charcoal production and how to
40:01
assess this with ls data and produce a
40:04
database of chogokin this is a historic
40:10
map from 80 50 or 80 45 the first the
40:15
first server which was done impression
40:17
where couples would be down here so this
40:20
is Heights you have already seen in one
40:23
of the area of use with the ponds add
40:26
pipe there was the iron work where they
40:29
produce the yeah these guns etc and so
40:36
from the surrounding they needed the
40:39
charcoal and this is the young schwate
40:42
area so these villages are already gone
40:44
so the mind is now about here and so the
40:49
black line is the former area of the
40:53
forest which is locally called a high
40:56
day so that's kind of it's some kind of
40:58
a forest and all the red dots are
41:03
excavated chocolate coins up to now
41:06
there's more than thousand charcoal King
41:09
remains that have been excavated and
41:12
surveyed also this is by far the largest
41:17
archaeological known charcoal canfield
41:20
in Europe an interesting feature of this
41:27
charcoal and Kern remains is that due to
41:31
the construction so this was the shape
41:35
of the child cream once it was built so
41:40
then they took out the charcoal and it
41:44
what remained is that little mound here
41:47
and a little ditch surrounding this
41:50
charcoal current remain so from a top
41:54
view you find these ditches here as
41:57
circular structures and a little mound
42:00
in the center taking now these
42:03
high-resolution LS theta so these are
42:06
airborne laser scanning or
42:09
these are then produced so-called shaded
42:12
relief maps SRM so with this
42:15
high-resolution data you can analyze
42:18
this structure so you see this circus
42:22
structure here yeah and if you make
42:25
cross sections through this structure
42:27
the elevation here is meter above sea
42:29
level that's 84.2 285 so this is the
42:33
sole skate is just 80 sent 80
42:35
centimeters point eight meters and you
42:38
see very small differences so this is
42:41
the ditch and there's a ditch and
42:42
there's a little mound and this addition
42:44
there's a little mound in the middle so
42:48
and as a result in these SRM images you
42:53
find all over these circle structures
42:57
yeah here and here here and here and
43:01
here which can be identified as former
43:03
charcoal turns so what we then called
43:06
charcoal can remains going coming back
43:12
to to the interval decide one of the PhD
43:15
students comprise all the data for this
43:19
former forest site and you see the the
43:22
black one here now are the excavated one
43:24
and the red one are the one which are
43:27
identified by these laser scanning
43:29
analysis and in a first approach we
43:35
identify just for the enchilada side
43:38
five stars or potential charcoal can
43:41
remain ground plans just for that one
43:44
side later on we have seen that we have
43:48
to revise this and we now for sure that
43:53
for this side we have 1500 choco
43:56
complains once we have the data we can
44:00
do some statistic on it we can
44:03
prove we can show or can analyze how
44:07
long what is the the diameter do we have
44:11
small ones do we have large ones
44:12
something like that and we can analyze
44:16
the spatial distribution of the
44:18
different sizes so we can classify this
44:21
the smaller ones the medium ones and the
44:23
very large ones and we can show where
44:26
are these ones located especially in
44:28
relation to the former ironwork ok we of
44:34
course you want to know what ages do you
44:36
have h can be determined by during
44:40
analysis or dendro analysis the first
44:44
published data set was from this year
44:48
with 13 80s or 16 ages and we have now
44:51
new date dates up to more than 60 once
44:55
updated and we have ages between mid of
45:01
the 16th century middle of the 19th
45:04
century and that's exactly the range
45:06
when the ironwork heights operated so
45:11
concluding that as I mentioned we have
45:16
detected 5000 potential AQHA coincides
45:20
in an area of 30 square kilometers by
45:23
ree assessment or reevaluation where we
45:27
can confirm at least 1500 and this just
45:32
this number for the one side can we can
45:36
conclude that we have lots of these
45:40
sites here in the North German lowland
45:42
but it's simply not have been studied
45:46
before and we have several more
45:49
questions to answer of course what is
45:52
the effect on the forest so how much
45:56
wood was used for the production of the
45:58
chocolatier and then we want to expand
46:02
or extend this research to other regions
46:05
and using automatic detection procedures
46:12
for that so with the project started
46:15
here directly in the mining area we now
46:19
go to other areas which are not mind in
46:25
this side and the first result of this
46:29
ongoing project shows us yes we have
46:32
lots of these chocolate curls here and
46:36
really thousands and thousands of these
46:38
chocolate in remains in still hidden on
46:41
our forest canopy this is just a very
46:47
it's very complicated just refer to the
46:52
literature this is anna schneider
46:55
postdoc with my group she established
46:59
automatic mapping routine to identify
47:02
all these chocolate remains with GIS
47:08
because the first approach we made
47:10
indian choix later this was just done
47:13
manually by a person sitting on a
47:15
computer and this was also the reason as
47:19
we had this high failure percentage so
47:25
because it's just a matter of the
47:28
operator of the of the machine that you
47:32
produce a lot of failures and she
47:39
started now to work in other areas north
47:42
of generality and so to go back here so
47:48
PI 2 c-ing quality is here and the next
47:53
slide shows the area north of it and
47:56
again this is the topography this is our
48:01
the chocolates and this is the density
48:04
calculated for this so again we see
48:08
thousands of these chocolate cream
48:11
here in the area okay at the end I would
48:17
like to emphasize that this finding is
48:21
not a regional one so it's a very recent
48:23
one so it's really fascinating to see
48:27
that we have now proof of these charcoal
48:35
can remain but there are other areas in
48:38
over the world where we find this
48:40
charcoal can remains and I just returned
48:43
from the u.s. from in October where did
48:47
some field work together with a
48:49
colleague from the University of
48:51
Connecticut this is a map of Western
48:54
Connecticut so New York City would be
48:56
down 150 kilometers to the south west
49:01
and all these blue points are these
49:05
clouds of blue points or dots our
49:08
chocolate girl remains and the yellow
49:11
dots here are the ones we studies and if
49:13
you look this is again SRM image you see
49:18
all the dots here yeah all over the area
49:22
so the whole and it's completely
49:25
forested nowadays so the whole area is
49:29
full of these charcoal kiln remains we
49:33
did some trenching on it and you see in
49:36
this example how so this is the charcoal
49:40
can platform and this is how the
49:43
charcoal complete from looks in the soil
49:45
profile you see these dark structures
49:47
here with dark colors so these are the
49:50
remains of the of the charcoal in
49:52
production and interestingly so these
49:56
are two pictures from the same so the
49:59
one is from here the ones from from that
50:01
point you see that this picture you just
50:04
had one dark day up and here if one dark
50:06
layer a second dark layer and the right
50:08
there so this is approved for us that
50:11
there was at least two times the site
50:15
was used for chocolate production two
50:20
pictures at the end
50:22
so this is from a book called kinetic
50:25
and mining so we were exactly at this
50:28
site so this is from 19 5 either they
50:32
are completely cleared for the charcoal
50:35
production and if you go nowadays to
50:38
this area it's completely forests it
50:41
again so once you stand here you will
50:44
not would not realize that 100 150 years
50:48
ago it was completely deforested okay
50:51
that's it
