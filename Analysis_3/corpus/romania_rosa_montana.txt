in the Russia Montana region of
00:18
neighboring Romania plans are underway
00:20
to open the biggest open pit goldmine in
00:22
Europe should the project of the Russia
00:25
Montana Gold Corporation go ahead the
00:27
surrounding mountains will be carved
00:29
into four enormous mining pits and the
00:32
nearby Valley will be transformed into a
00:34
dam of cyanide-laced tailings an
00:36
enormous environmental liability in case
00:38
of design failure that could far surpass
00:41
the disaster and hungry environmental
00:44
concerns are not the only ones driving
00:45
the opposition the village of Russia
00:48
Montana is one of the oldest mining
00:50
sites in the world where precious metals
00:52
have been continuously extracted
00:54
underground for almost 2,000 years the
00:57
grandeur of the Roman Empire was
00:58
bankrolled with local gold and some of
01:01
the original galleries are still
01:02
preserved offering invaluable treasures
01:05
to archeologists and historians alike
01:08
people like the local farmer Eugene
01:10
David have other ideas for the region
01:12
and have proposed various alternatives
01:14
to industrial mining like cultural and
01:16
environmental tourism small-scale
01:19
farming beekeeping in artisanal mining
01:23
aundrea Gruber the owner of a local
01:26
hostel whose family used to be one of
01:28
the most famous and richest mining
01:30
families in the region before the
01:31
Communists took everything in 1948 also
01:35
believes that there is a future in
01:36
tourism a potential inclusion in the
01:39
UNESCO World Heritage List would further
01:41
boost the appeal of the region
01:43
especially if the site is managed well
01:48
still other locals like the 46 year old
01:51
geologist Vardhan Marceau who works for
01:54
the company look at such alternatives
01:56
with skepticism and believe that without
01:58
investments in mining there is no future
02:00
for Rocha Montana
02:06
in such a polarized environment it is
02:09
very difficult to imagine that the case
02:11
of Rocha Montana would be resolved
02:13
anytime soon neither side is willing to
02:15
give up and in the final run no
02:18
compromise seems possible
