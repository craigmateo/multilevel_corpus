Uranium Mining

president Trump dismantled a number of
00:02
Obama era initiatives during his first
00:04
year in office and that could eventually
00:06
include a ban on uranium mining near the
00:08
Grand Canyon Vanessa barchfield brings
00:10
us the story the Canyon Mine is located
00:13
at the end of a dirt road in the Kaibab
00:15
National Forest
00:16
about six miles south of the Grand
00:18
Canyon deep below the muddy surface the
00:21
earth here is rich with uranium today
00:24
it's the only working uranium mine on
00:26
the land surrounding the Grand Canyon
00:28
and in fact no uranium is being
00:30
extracted yet Canyon mines still under
00:32
construction its existence is a major
00:35
point of contention between
00:36
environmental groups tribes the mining
00:39
industry and local and federal entities
00:41
but before we get to that a little
00:43
history in the years after World War Two
00:46
and the early days of the Cold War the
00:48
US was racing to develop an arsenal of
00:50
nuclear weapons that led to a massive
00:53
boom in uranium mining a lot of these
00:56
mines were on the Navajo Nation and a
00:59
lot of people got rich and a lot of
01:01
Navajo got sick back in the 1950s and
01:04
60s there wasn't any regulation so to
01:07
speak on uranium mining is it's
01:09
basically a bunch of unventilated dirty
01:12
little holes in the ground miners were
01:15
exposed to radon gas unsafe mining
01:17
conditions underground and when
01:19
companies left they simply abandon their
01:22
minds without cleaning them up which has
01:24
led to a long legacy of water
01:25
contamination on the reservation by the
01:28
1970s most of the uranium being mined
01:31
around the world was used in nuclear
01:33
power plants and Frank vane says the
01:35
mining industry cleaned itself up the
01:38
the modern industry is highly regulated
01:41
the health of the miners is a very high
01:46
priority type thing for the mining
01:48
companies to be looking after over the
01:51
decades the price of uranium has been
01:53
highly volatile a spike in prices in the
01:56
mid 2000s led to a flurry of company
01:58
staking claims for uranium mines on the
02:01
public lands near the Grand Canyon the
02:03
coalition of groups band together to
02:05
lobby the previous administration to
02:07
intervene the interior secretary under
02:10
President Obama Ken Salazar was
02:12
persuaded
02:13
that this poses too much of a risk so in
02:17
2012 the Obama administration introduced
02:19
a 20-year withdrawal or we'll call it a
02:22
ban on new mining claims on more than a
02:24
million acres of land near the Grand
02:26
Canyon 11 existing mining operations
02:29
were allowed to continue including
02:31
Canyon mine opponents like the Grand
02:33
Canyon trust make a number of arguments
02:35
against the mine we are pragmatically
02:38
opposed to contaminated Springs and
02:42
waterways around the Grand Canyon around
02:44
the Four Corners area and the history
02:46
and the legacy of that contamination is
02:48
our evidence for being concerned Clark
02:51
also says that the Canyon mines plan of
02:53
operations was originally drafted in the
02:56
mid-1980s when the mine was first
02:58
approved the company that owns it Energy
03:00
Fuels put the project on hiatus between
03:03
then and 2012 yet the plans haven't
03:06
changed two of our strongest supporters
03:09
for development the canyon mine is the
03:11
Forest Service and the Arizona
03:13
Department of Environmental Quality and
03:15
I can assure you that neither of those
03:17
groups would allow the Canyon mine to go
03:20
forward if they thought there was going
03:22
to be any risk to the environment now
03:26
scientists with the United States
03:27
Geological Survey have said their
03:29
ability to study the risked the
03:31
environment has been hindered by
03:32
inconsistent federal funding and they're
03:35
still significant unknowns when it comes
03:37
to the impact that uranium mining has on
03:40
groundwater the Grand Canyon trusts
03:42
Roger Clark is more certain about the
03:44
risks the science is clear uranium
03:47
mining contaminates surface and ground
03:50
in the groundwater and there's no way to
03:54
entirely avoid that and to mitigate it
03:57
the Grand Canyon watershed provides
03:58
drinking water to approximately 25
04:00
million people that's because it feeds
04:03
into the Colorado River energy fuels as
04:05
Mark Chandler says uranium is already
04:07
naturally eroding into the Colorado and
04:10
not because of mining when you're in the
04:12
Grand Canyon there's actually a number
04:14
of places you can go out and touch your
04:16
rhenium right on the edge of the canyon
04:18
walls that is currently eroding into the
04:21
Colorado environmental groups say it's
04:23
not the naturally occurring uranium that
04:25
worried
04:26
them the Havasupai people who sole
04:29
source of water is the groundwater
04:31
beneath Canyon mine are really in a
04:36
position of being guinea pigs we are
04:39
opposed to Canyon mine for many reasons
04:42
one of the reasons is is that it is
04:45
located right above our water source red
04:48
WOM WOM aquifer mining consultant Frank
04:51
Bain says the risks video aquifer is
04:54
blown out of proportion I just don't buy
04:56
that you know I don't I don't see the
04:57
direct link between the uranium mines
05:01
and a water table it's a thousand feet
05:03
deeper if the content water was to be
05:06
contaminated we believe that the
05:09
existence of the Havasupai will
05:12
disappear there is no potential risk for
05:17
the canyon mine to contaminate the water
05:19
at Havasupai zero none Carletta to lose
05:23
e says it's not just about the water the
05:26
mind is already desecrating to Havasu
05:28
PI's sacred site we have evidence to
05:31
prove that there is a lot of rock
05:34
writings pottery shards ancient trails
05:38
including burial sites in that area that
05:41
we're very concerned about and we want
05:44
those areas to be protected I just want
05:46
to say that we are not going to harm the
05:49
indigenous communities or the Navajos
05:51
would have a soup pies and we're
05:53
certainly not going to harm the Grand
05:54
Canyon but mining is impact on the Grand
05:56
Canyon is a point of contention for the
05:59
Coconino County Board of Supervisors
06:00
which has long opposed uranium mining in
06:03
the area we believe very strongly that
06:05
that those who take the risks of uranium
06:09
mining are our residents our tribal
06:11
partners our communities and those to
06:14
take the benefit do not typically live
06:16
here and we want to make sure that we
06:17
protect these assets for our local
06:19
economies or regional economies and our
06:21
communities energy fuels as Mark
06:23
Chalmers says there's a lot of focus on
06:26
the negatives of Canyon mine and there's
06:28
a heck of a lot of positives about the
06:30
canyon mine and one is clean energy he
06:34
points to the fact that uranium is used
06:35
in the nuclear power plants that
06:37
generate 20% of the electricity
06:39
in this country Roger Clark the Grand
06:41
Canyon tres says though nuclear's carbon
06:44
footprint is less than coals that's not
06:46
the full picture it still takes fossil
06:49
fuels to mind to move and to provide
06:52
that service Andy says the federal
06:54
government is still burying the cost of
06:56
cleaning up more than 500 contaminated
06:59
mines on the Navajo reservation and then
07:01
on the tail end what do you do with the
07:03
nuclear waste and where does that go and
07:05
who's going to pay for managing and
07:07
containing that for the next 10,000
07:09
years now remember earlier when we were
07:11
talking about the volatility of uranium
07:13
prices well today they're extremely low
07:16
in part because Japan shut down its
07:18
nuclear reactors after the disaster at
07:20
Fukushima there's this big glut of
07:23
uranium that's that's on the world
07:26
market now and nobody's using it and the
07:28
price has basically gone from a hundred
07:30
and thirty or forty dollars a pound down
07:32
to twenty twenty dollars a pound you
07:35
can't afford to mine uranium
07:36
I think uranium mining around you did I
07:39
think mr. Bane's conclusion that the
07:43
uranium industry is dead is premature
07:46
and he knows as well as anyone else that
07:48
watches the market that it's cyclic it's
07:50
on a down cycle right now but it could
07:52
be back this year and energy fuels is
07:56
betting on uranium prices rebounding
07:58
mark Chalmers says right now
08:00
prices are too low for his company to
08:02
extract any uranium from Canyon mine
08:04
most of the world producers of uranium
08:08
need prices in the order of $50 per
08:11
pound to make them profitable to go
08:15
forward as Energy Fuels waits for prices
08:17
to trend upward the Trump administration
08:19
is now considering reversing a 20-year
08:21
ban following a recommendation last year
08:24
from the u.s. Forest Service Roger Clark
08:26
says his group is concerned the ban will
08:28
be overturned it would allow an
08:33
indeterminate number of uranium claims
08:35
to move forward and become mines in
08:38
those watersheds that drain directly
08:40
into the Grand Canyon
08:41
his organization the Havasupai and other
08:44
groups say they'll continue to fight
08:46
keep mining out of the region and as the
08:49
debate goes on Energy Fuels continues
08:51
work on developing Canyon
08:53
it's shaft goes a bit deeper into the
08:55
ground each day
