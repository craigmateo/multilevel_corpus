The Big Debate (ep. 6, March 24): Does Mining Benefit Africa?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbZ96n62DiY
here in Zambia copper mines are booming
00:19
rising demand means right across Africa
00:22
the prospect for mining are bright yet
00:25
some of the continents most mineral rich
00:27
countries are also the poorest when it
00:29
comes to human development join me for
00:31
this world debate does mining benefit
00:34
Africa
00:50
hello and welcome to the world debate am
00:53
ready cabbie and I'm at the first mining
00:55
and Investment Forum in Lusaka Zambia
00:57
I'm joined by a very diverse group of
01:00
guests all of whom have a keen interest
01:02
in understanding where the income from
01:04
Africa's mineral wealth ends up who's on
01:07
my panel sittin back o Musa cut Ronnie
01:10
the Minister of Finance here in Zambia
01:12
and the man responsible for setting the
01:14

01:17
for determining how government income is

02:25
welcome to my panel and to our audience
02:27
here in Lusaka
02:37
before we start our debate does mining
02:40
benefit Africa let's take a look at this
02:42
overview Zambians and international
02:48
investors celebrate the opening of a new
02:50
copper mine in 2009 according to the
02:54
African Union Africa holds two fifths of
02:57
the world's uranium and gold
02:59
three-quarters of the world's platinum
03:00
and 90% of the world's diamonds and
03:03
prices of most of these commodities are
03:05
soaring on world markets yet most
03:09
Africans still live in poverty
03:11
last year the UN reported that 35 of the
03:14
world's poorest countries are in Africa
03:16
so what explains the failure to use
03:19
Africa's riches to uplift the continent
03:21
citizens mr. mom whey has spent 22 years
03:25
driving an underground train in a
03:27
Zambian copper mine his father was also
03:29
a copper miner here in get we're on the
03:32
Zambian copper belt he lives in a small
03:34
two-room house with his wife and
03:36
extended family and he feels workers
03:39
like himself receive a raw deal from the
03:41
company bundle toilets here don't of
03:45
toilets no water we fetch water from all
03:51
of our neighboring River community
03:53
toilets public lands
03:59
would Spain's me mr. Mumbai has seen the
04:04
mind change hands from the Zambian
04:05
government to the private sector he
04:08
believes that the privatization of the
04:10
mine a decade ago is one of the reasons
04:12
why workers like himself have not
04:14
benefited more from Zambia's copper
04:17
wealth try say the government is greedy
04:20
once they privatize the mines so they do
04:23
today
04:24
the government's tool to see the
04:26
condition of workers nothing has been
04:29
achieved his employer is more bunny
04:31
copper mines one of the largest mines in
04:33
the world
04:34
Maupin is majority shareholder is
04:36
multinational commodity trading company
04:38
Glencore claim cause 10 billion u.s.
04:41
dollar listing in May this year was the
04:43
largest ever on the London Stock
04:45
Exchange a recent audit study
04:47
commissioned by the Zambian Revenue
04:49
Authority and leaked to the public
04:51
earlier this year
04:52
accuses Mabini and Glencore of
04:54
understating their revenues and
04:56
overstating their costs in order to
04:58
avoid paying taxes the report also
05:00
accuses more binding of selling copper
05:03
to its parent company at discount prices
05:05
Mopani and Concord deny the allegations
05:08
accusations that mining companies in
05:10
Africa are guilty of tax evasion by
05:12
cooking the books are not new in 2006
05:16
the extractive industries transparency
05:18
initiative or EIT I was established as a
05:21
global partnership between governments
05:23
mining companies and community groups to
05:25
help ensure greater openness
05:30
country's wishing to be fully ITI
05:32
members must produce a report setting
05:34
out all the payments from mining
05:36
companies and all the receipts to the
05:38
government in zambia the text is paid by
05:42
mining companies used to be secret
05:44
zambia recently published an e ITI
05:46
report setting out these payments and
05:49
hopes to gain full a ITI membership soon
05:51
mining Minister maximum wali says that
05:54
this process has improved accountability
05:56
at local level most communities in the
06:00
money areas do not realize that the
06:03
money companies pay what we call rights
06:08
to their local authorities and is out of
06:12
those risks that the local authorities
06:15
are supposed to provide services to
06:18
those communities Zambia has been
06:20
criticised for failing to increase its
06:22
text levels enough now that
06:23
international copper prices are at an
06:25
all-time high but the government argues
06:28
that the benefits of mining are clear
06:30
for everyone to see employment tax and
06:33
improvements in the areas around the
06:35
mines at the loom 1 a copper mine
06:38
the mining company built houses and
06:40
schools for the local community even
06:42
before beginning production but critics
06:45
of the way mining operates in Africa
06:47
point to both the impact of mining
06:49
pollution and waste on people's health
06:51
and the fact that the majority of people
06:53
even in resource-rich African countries
06:56
like Zambia still live in poverty the
06:59
policy framework is not conducive it's
07:02
doesn't benefit the Zambian in fact it
07:05
benefits the investors more than it you
07:09
know that then it benefits the local
07:11
people and that's exactly our challenge
07:13
we want the government to come up with
07:15
policies and regulations that will
07:18
benefit the Sundering people all right
07:20
let's start with you tere short you have
07:22
said that resources are accursed to
07:25
African countries where they located how
07:28
could you make such an astonishing
07:28
statement I'm quoting other people I'm
07:31
not the first say
07:33
it's not just Africa it's more broadly
07:35
countries that are rich in mineral
07:37
resources and in oil tend to have
07:40
problems of corruption poor governance a
07:42
lot of money leaving the country rich
07:44
elite not sharing with all the people it
07:48
goes with the territory and what we've
07:50
got to do is change that because it
07:52
really isn't good enough those resources
07:53
belong to the people
07:54
Minnesota care does have a point doesn't
07:57
she you are known in Zambia as the
07:59
powerhouse especially when it comes to
08:01
copper mining and yet there is high
08:03
unemployment here you count amongst the
08:06
25 poorest nations how do you reconcile
08:09
the mineral wealth and the poverty in
08:11
this country well first of all please do
08:15
remember that a lot of the profits that
08:18
we see today in Zambia is precisely
08:21
because we in the 70s 80s and 90s we
08:26
copied what the Labour government in the
08:28
UK did which was to nationalize
08:31
everything and then a few years later
08:33
they discovered themselves that that
08:35
going the wrong direction they privatize
08:38
we didn't do that you know it's very
08:40
difficult for government to run a mine
08:42
so the privatisation but with
08:44
privatization are you getting a good
08:46
deal as Zambia we are getting a good
08:49
deal
08:50
the moment we nationalize production
08:53
went down like this the moment we
08:55
privatize the situation went up like
08:58
that the end result you see the amount
09:01
of investment taking place in the
09:02
country the increasing material
09:05
well-being of the Zambian people there's
09:07
- a lot getting poor I mean there's - a
09:09
lot - are poor but we are getting there
09:12
and the path that we have taken to the
09:14
correct one I'm going to challenge you
09:15
on that fact leader of them but Emmanuel
09:17
mitachi that video that we've just seen
09:19
a worker working for Mopani for 22 years
09:23
that is a very very long time a company
09:26
that reported billions in profits just
09:28
last year and you have a worker who has
09:31
loyally worked for you for 22 years no
09:34
electricity no toilets and living in
09:37
poverty that can't be right I think we
09:40
need to understand where we're coming
09:42
from
09:42
at the time of privatisation
09:45
the house stock was delinked from the
09:50
new mine owners and became private
09:52
property of individual miners the
09:56
responsibility for that transferred from
09:58
the new mine owners to the council's
10:01
until passing the back here it's other
10:04
people not Mopani not no no no I'm
10:07
coming to that point they do have
10:09
electricity
10:10
the troilus have been an issue and as
10:13
Malpani we have stepped in we are
10:15
spending 4.5 million dollars to
10:17
construct 1,800 toilets with water
10:20
facility and these toilets will be
10:23
complete in august this year let's talk
10:25
about the much-talked-about audit report
10:28
that was leaked that showed massive
10:31
corruption mispricing
10:33
and you are being accused as Mopani by
10:35
glen Fontan of actually inflating your
10:38
operational costs but at the same time
10:41
under estimating your production volumes
10:45
they essentially accusing you of cooking
10:47
your books are you it's most unfortunate
10:51
that that report was leaked before it
10:54
was even discussed with us why is it
10:56
relevant to discuss it before was it
10:57
true or not were you cooking
10:59
no it's not absolutely not the auditors
11:02
failed to understand the process of
11:07
mining 50 percent of the copper that we
11:10
treat comes from extender from other
11:13
companies and when we have 10 that
11:17
material into finished copper we have to
11:19
give it back to the to the other
11:24
campaign unfortunately the report so
11:27
could the total volume coming out of our
11:30
refinery multiply that by the price at
11:34
that time and attributed orders to
11:37
Mopani
11:37
when in fact only 50 percent is saying
11:40
you obstructed the investigations and I
11:41
think for me this reveals a fundamental
11:44
problem of the mining process how is it
11:47
that in this complicated mining
11:48
relationship with us stakeholders and
11:50
many other stakeholders from civil
11:52
societies you seem to be the only ones
11:54
who understand the business model does
11:55
that not reflect the
11:57
apparently and openness if you had been
12:02
more transparent and open everybody else
12:04
would understand your business module we
12:07
are transparent as they can be
12:10
everybody's anybody is free to come and
12:13
visit us and see what we do there's
12:16
another accusation that is also quite
12:18
serious that you as Mopani
12:20
you're selling copper to your parent
12:22
company Glencore at a lower level as a
12:25
seller surely you should be striving to
12:27
enjoy maximum benefits from that which
12:30
you sell as a as a producer on the
12:33
seller we get our revenues based on the
12:37
prevailing price on the London Metal
12:39
Exchange Steve let's talk about the
12:42
power relations between companies and
12:44
government as they reflect themselves in
12:46
Ghana what can you tell us about that
12:48
clearly you have a situation where the
12:51
companies operating in our countries
12:53
have budgets several times the budget of
12:57
the host country and therefore clearly
12:59
they are able to influence the political
13:01
elite into getting Contras that actually
13:04
in your to the exclusive advantage but
13:07
again on the question of why we fail to
13:10
maximize benefits it's clearly a failure
13:13
of governance which has given a full day
13:16
to the mining companies you have a
13:19
situation in Africa where most countries
13:22
are not mining coats before thinking
13:24
about policy this is clearly an
13:27
aberration because clearly you need to
13:29
have a policy which articulates your
13:31
vision in terms of what role you expect
13:33
mine to play in your national economy
13:35
minister is the failure of governance
13:37
here in Africa well I can't speak about
13:40
Ghana but certainly for Zambia the way
13:43
we do the policies say for example in
13:45
taxation you have to understand that in
13:49
this world there's the cooperation
13:51
between those with resources and both
13:53
with the financial means
13:55
we can have the minerals in the grounds
13:58
but at this point in time if we are not
14:01
able to attract those with the financial
14:04
means to come and work with us then
14:06
there'll be no mind taking so far do you
14:08
go in that I'm reminded of what everyone
14:11
else has said that Zambia cannot
14:12
continue to get pennies for its mineral
14:15
wealth there's also a leading economist
14:16
from Oxford who said Paul Colliers who
14:20
said that in Zambia the wealth has been
14:23
plundered to the benefit of the
14:24
companies and not the people he singles
14:26
out Zambia as a case in point so how far
14:29
do you go in the workers I agree with
14:30
that when it comes to issues of sharing
14:32
for example issues of taxation we've
14:35
looked at the tax law in South Africa we
14:38
have looked at the tax laws in Canada
14:39
Australia Brazil Ghana everywhere our
14:43
tax law is comparable for anyone
14:47
therefore to say we are acting out
14:49
outside the norms when what we have is
14:52
comparable with what obtains everywhere
14:54
in the world that is a terrible mistake
14:56
and if we go along this route this is
15:00
the beginning of poverty because this is
15:02
the way we were being taught in the 70s
15:04
that look we are being exploited take
15:07
everything away that we are going to
15:09
reach the very opposite end because
15:12
unfortunately this competition about
15:14
investment we can't AXA you can't do
15:17
your laws outside what everybody else
15:18
does now I want to manage that model
15:20
because then clearly we think we seem to
15:23
think that by lowering taxes we make our
15:26
countries attracted to foreign direct
15:28
investment it's misplaced it is
15:30
misplaced because the copper can be
15:32
found only in few places in the world it
15:34
will go anywhere if we leave it in the
15:36
ground
15:36
so Minister that's exactly it have you
15:38
fallen have you fallen for the blackmail
15:40
where investors are threatening you with
15:41
leaving an example in Zimbabwe there's
15:43
talk of indigenisation but there lot of
15:45
money there's a lot of mining activity
15:47
that is still happening live in one as
15:49
mana I raised the windfall tax and there
15:52
was much agitation and then it was
15:54
dropped again you're letting them
15:55
determine the terms of this relationship
15:58
why don't you tell me in mining country
16:00
in the world that is wind for tax
16:03
in the mana data it was introduced in we
16:06
don't find it in Chile you don't find in
16:08
Australia we don't find in Canada you
16:11
don't find that you bring it in
16:12
Australia yeah and the government went
16:14
down so why do you want Africans to
16:16
always to do the wrong things so that
16:18
they become poor and in the end we end
16:21
up saying the Africans that mismanaging
16:33
just just respond to that these are my
16:36
multinational investors they are the
16:38
engine of I columns rounding them all
16:40
over the world there's been secrecy
16:43
total secrecy about the contracts about
16:45
how much the production wise but how
16:48
much they really pay to the government
16:50
how much the government receives if
16:52
there's nothing to hide let's get all of
16:53
this out in the open let the people know
16:55
what it costs how much being produced
16:57
what proportion of profits have been
16:59
paid in taxis that's what we're trying
17:01
to do with IIIT I for part of it so that
17:04
the people can know and the people can
17:06
then hold Alex to account so you don't
17:08
go far enough do you love it no we we
17:11
can't do it all because we're a
17:12
coalition of companies governments and
17:15
civil society so we can only go as far
17:17
as that coalition will go but once we
17:19
start to get the figures out in the open
17:20
people can ask more questions what was
17:22
the level of production you know
17:24
therefore how much of the tax came to
17:26
our country compared one country with
17:28
another but this is a this is a systemic
17:31
problem all over the place there's so
17:32
much money around oil and minerals and
17:36
of course commodity prices go up and
17:38
down but a lot of this gets hidden and
17:40
all these companies tend not to pay as
17:42
much as they should
17:43
towards the countries in which their
17:45
base certainly when the prices are going
17:47
up we should share that benefit with
17:51
indigenous people well sure char we know
17:55
we showed that's why I'm coming to the
17:57
point the principle of having wind for
18:00
tax or any form of tax that reflects the
18:05
increase in prices is welcome what was
18:09
wrong with wind for tax was the
18:10
application of it the principles fine
18:13
the mechanics were wrong right wind for
18:17
tax was applied to total revenue
18:20
regardless of your cost levels what the
18:23
minister saying is what would like to
18:25
see you allowed a certain margin of
18:27
profit above which you have say a
18:30
sliding scale of Taxation and that is
18:32
fine then you can share those benefits
18:35
and reduce amount from valet the
18:37
second-largest mining company in the
18:39
world with operations in a number of
18:41
African countries you've got your own
18:43
tax issues the government in brass
18:45
is asking you to pay 15 billion US
18:49
dollars in Texas money that you've made
18:52
in your foreign operations you're
18:54
challenging the government's request for
18:55
you to pay this money in Texas I'm not
18:59
subject I can just say that that's in
19:00
debate in Brazil it's a question of the
19:03
form by which we valued the royalties
19:05
versus what the government is has
19:07
discussed also and it's an issue which
19:10
is in it's in debate with the government
19:12
but you I dispute you are disputing this
19:14
claim by the government that you have
19:16
unpaid taxes to the tune of 15 billion
19:18
US dollars the two of us are questioning
19:20
the forms by which you arrive at this
19:22
amount and the issue in general is is
19:25
under negotiations between Brazilian
19:27
counterparts in a bizarre government do
19:29
you think if there was more transparency
19:30
as Clare has said which was very clear
19:32
what you're making where and how that
19:34
you wouldn't be in this dispute I think
19:37
going forward in the industry as a whole
19:39
and for the private investors involved
19:41
transparency is no doubt essential to
19:44
creating more confidence by the investor
19:47
that creates more ease to make long-term
19:49
investments in the country because it's
19:50
not just a question of who invests in a
19:53
country but the quality of the
19:55
investment and where that goes
19:56
not just in mining but mining is a
19:58
platform for long-term economic could I
20:01
add it's both other companies paying
20:03
fairly are they hiding what they make in
20:05
different countries in the way that's
20:07
been being alleged but there's then also
20:09
question how much goes to the government
20:10
and how is the government spending the
20:12
money there's two streams of
20:14
accountability is the government
20:15
spending the money well on the people
20:17
and the poorest people who need it most
20:19
or are the elite getting richer and the
20:21
poor getting poorer that's the second
20:23
part of the question
20:26
aren't you being a bit unrealistic
20:29
there are operational costs often the
20:31
multinational companies come to a
20:33
country at great great risks to
20:35
themselves this political instability in
20:37
some countries are you just imagining
20:40
this utopia where you get everything
20:42
that you put in
20:43
no we it's not only just my imagination
20:46
clearly we give a lot of incentives to
20:49
get them to come over and so they pay
20:52
very little in terms of taxes by even a
20:54
very little that is required of them to
20:56
pay
20:57
they don't pay and that's where in lies
20:59
the problem I think some time which
21:00
techniques for generalizing here Steve
21:02
we tend to over simplify the tax it's
21:04
very a function of tax levels it is a
21:06
function of our ability to collect the
21:08
taxes that are imposed and I think we
21:11
have weak tax administrative systems and
21:13
that allows the companies to get away
21:14
with the non-payment of taxes as we is
21:16
been alleged that case is very volatile
21:18
but you've got to take what Steve is
21:21
saying the point that Steve is saying
21:22
because in the case of Mopani it was the
21:24
Zambian tax authority that commissioned
21:28
this much disputed report by Grant
21:31
Thornton that suggests that they had
21:32
suspicions that Mopani is not declaring
21:36
everything that it has made and that's
21:38
not paying the taxes that it should have
21:40
paid well it is true it is the Zambian
21:44
tax authorities the German government
21:45
that commissioned these studies and with
21:47
the assistance of cooperating partners
21:50
and I must also say that this study was
21:54
not specifically mob planning this study
21:57
was on three mining companies in Zambia
22:00
Mopani Fisk quantum & KCM and in all
22:06
three their issues to be resolved so
22:09
sometimes I get amused that the focus is
22:11
on punny of course I'm happy because
22:14
hopefully they'll be more tax coming out
22:16
of this but they will say
22:21
there are three companies and in each of
22:24
these three companies there are issues
22:26
so we have to publish the reports the
22:30
reports I think belong to the Revenue
22:31
Authority can we have them published
22:33
Minister would you do that
22:35
well you see please do remember that tax
22:38
law everywhere in the world zambia and
22:41
elsewhere the tax issues of an
22:43
individual company and the tax authority
22:46
is not something that you come and
22:48
display in public that's the wealth of
22:50
the people why not why don't you be bold
22:52
why don't you be bold and tell people
22:54
who owned the mineral wealth what is
22:56
coming in within the laws that you pass
22:59
whether it is in Africa whether it is
23:01
Europe you must act according to a law
23:03
the public interest is a riding
23:06
principle in the interpretation of the
23:07
law insofar as it borders on the public
23:09
interest I think the public has to know
23:11
please understand this if the tax
23:14
authorities in Ghana had issues with you
23:16
specifically I'm a personal person yeah
23:19
well I mean an individual yeah
23:21
the moment they started publishing those
23:24
correspondence with you in the public
23:25
you have the legal rights to take them
23:28
to court it doesn't the Minister is
23:29
appointed the Minister has a point you
23:31
can't put sensitive information out
23:32
there in the public are you saying that
23:35
there should be transparency to a point
23:37
that we know every single strategy every
23:40
single piece of information I forgot the
23:42
multinational car you should know what
23:44
companies invest what they produce what
23:48
the profits are what they pay in tax
23:50
what the workers get paid these are
23:54
resources that is correct about the
23:56
exchange between me and the tax person
23:59
not your letters and we don't need your
24:01
letters we just need the figures the
24:03
figures are open
24:07
the minister the figures are open we're
24:10
a public company we submit our annual
24:13
accounts to the Securities Exchange it
24:17
was a bitch to the Minister of Mines and
24:20
the half-year results go into the paper
24:23
but the allegation is that and this is
24:25
widespread there's a hiding of profits
24:28
along across the world to minimize
24:30
taxation this isn't only here this is
24:33
widely alleged there are lots of
24:34
multinational companies do this ok let's
24:36
go to the World Bank
24:37
kappakappa help us out here how should
24:40
we resolved our issues around
24:41
transparency and openness frankly I
24:44
don't see any issues around transparency
24:46
and openness what I hear everyone
24:48
agreeing is there needs to be greater
24:50
levels of transparency there need to be
24:52
greater levels of openness my personal
24:54
view is this debate is far too narrow
24:55
what countries like Zambia need is the
24:58
creation of jobs ok what is very very
25:00
critical is not only countries like
25:02
Zambia need to mobilize more revenues
25:04
but what they do with these revenues how
25:06
they invest these revenues in health
25:08
education skills development
25:10
infrastructure and create the jobs that
25:12
are necessary for poverty reduction
25:14
transparency in the declaration of
25:16
revenues is just the starting point
25:18
because you know in the end the mines
25:21
will be used up the coal is gone in
25:24
Britain you have to use that wealth to
25:26
invest in the economy to lift up the
25:28
people to create new sectors of the
25:30
economy
25:30
so there's jobs for everyone beyond
25:32
mining if you don't do that when the
25:34
copper goes down in price or the copper
25:36
is finished
25:36
there's nothing
25:41
I think it's quite clear that before
25:46
privatisation and after privatization if
25:49
I was talking to one of the mining
25:50
Township where my plan is working the
25:52
communities are worse off in different
25:54
measures so I think we should not be
25:57
naive again the mining company is not
25:58
come here getting mined get the profits
26:00
and share voluntarily equal with us
26:02
those charged with decision making the
26:05
politicians must step up the
26:07
responsibility of making sure this
26:08
happens it won't happen voluntarily I
26:10
think we must make the mining companies
26:13
give us our fair share whether it means
26:15
negotiating with them a fair deal if
26:17
you're not willing to negotiate we
26:19
actually can do it by force increasing
26:22
our stake I'm not advocating for
26:23
nationalization but if you look at
26:25
countries like Botswana it's common
26:27
sense that it's only those governments
26:29
that of a large stake in the running
26:31
that you're making about these
26:32
investments that benefit mostly from
26:34
resources it's not happening in Zambia
26:36
and I think politicians have the
26:38
responsibility and unfortunately if one
26:40
was to close their eyes you think the
26:42
politicians and the many companies
26:43
belong to the same entity
26:58
Minister I'd like you to respond to this
27:01
that in Zimbabwe right now this policy
27:05
of indigenous Asian in South Africa
27:07
where I come from there are very
27:10
powerful politicians who are advocating
27:12
nationalization because they're saying
27:14
that the private companies have not
27:16
helped them at all are you not afraid
27:17
that if jobs are not being created if
27:20
the wealth doesn't go to the people
27:22
you'll be returning to that kind of
27:23
debate here in Zambia well good luck to
27:27
the Suburbans I would like to the South
27:30
Africans but for us
27:35
for us this is a path that we've trodden
27:38
before as I said in the 70s were being
27:42
told if you take over these mines then
27:45
you are going to be rich they're very
27:49
open saviour says that there's high
27:51
unemployment and in many areas the
27:53
situation hasn't improved with
27:55
privatization how do you respond to that
27:57
the answer to that is that if you are
28:00
thinking about saving the labor
28:02
intensive - of the service and so forth
28:04
that is no longer sustainable because
28:06
you have to compete against Chile and
28:08
all these people so forget about that
28:10
the way to increase the labour force in
28:13
the mining sector one continue to be
28:16
more attractive so that you don't just
28:18
depend on two or three mines to provide
28:19
the jobs but now you depend on 40 or 50
28:22
miles to create the jobs but there won't
28:24
be no of jobs just reminding people ISM
28:27
that is true - in the input sector let's
28:33
create industry that are going to
28:34
replace some of the inputs that we are
28:36
currently having in the mining sector so
28:38
that the jobs are being created on the
28:41
up top our output sucked sides let's
28:44
create this is what this government is
28:46
doing in the case of Zambia value
28:48
addition so that will make wires we make
28:51
bronze will make brass we make starter
28:54
motors to fit in the South African a
28:56
motor industries this is the way we are
28:58
going to create more
28:59
jobs and value addition and the country
29:02
also educate the people invest in other
29:04
sectors make an economy that's growing
29:06
that generates jobs in all all sorts of
29:09
sectors even some what is meant about
29:11
that the curse there's another way of
29:12
looking at that that because Africa is
29:14
endowed with mineral wealth perhaps
29:15
there are industries that have been
29:16
neglected that should have been
29:18
developed to create these positive
29:19
aspects wealth flows from oil and
29:21
minerals they go through the government
29:23
the government spends that money it
29:24
doesn't have to tax the people and think
29:26
of how to generate well from right
29:28
through the economy and so it just
29:31
everything focuses on the big streams of
29:33
money coming out of these sectors and it
29:35
holds back the development of the rest
29:36
of the economy that's the pattern you
29:38
know you know another perspective to
29:39
this unless we start using these
29:43
resource sectors to learn how to
29:46
interact with investor community unless
29:49
we use this an example we are going to
29:51
lag behind why because you've considered
29:53
Japan if country like Korea you've got
29:56
countries like Taiwan develop minerals
29:58
but they are rich why because they've
30:01
learned to know how to interact with
30:03
investment communities so that minerals
30:06
or no minerals they'll be able to make
30:08
money people can change risk in
30:10
commodities I like to add to the
30:13
minister's comments a bedrock of
30:15
economic growth in any country is
30:17
stability for investments be them local
30:20
private companies or international
30:22
companies that's very important however
30:24
there's three responsibilities there of
30:25
the private investor of the local
30:27
government of the civil society that we
30:29
have to work together now in the extent
30:31
to the private investor valley or any of
30:33
the company and we speak about this
30:35
under capacity sometimes where the
30:38
mining company has so much more but
30:40
that's knowledge of how contracts are
30:41
created of how they can claim what they
30:44
pay and what they don't pay and then the
30:45
local doesn't know well but we all need
30:48
to do here is reduce risk when we reduce
30:49
risk we're all more engaging more money
30:51
can flow and it can flow for a long term
30:53
and we can have quality investors
30:55
that's for 10 20 30 years our law in the
30:58
private sector needs to be to be engaged
31:00
in this dialogue with the civil society
31:03
and with the local governments and I
31:04
should say if there are models out there
31:07
about new ways in which contractors can
31:09
be created about new regimes which again
31:11
it's not a question of necessarily
31:12
paying more or less it's a question of
31:14
how the money is spent and on the
31:16
government side how is going to be spent
31:18
all right we are willing to share that
31:19
information and work towards it let's
31:21
find out more about how your company
31:23
valet operates especially when it comes
31:25
to the environment as mining companies
31:28
move into pristine new areas they are
31:31
becoming increasingly aware of the need
31:33
to address the fears expressed by local
31:35
people the Brazilian multinational
31:38
mining company Valley is rapidly
31:40
expanding its operations in Africa with
31:43
new mines being developed in at least
31:45
seven African countries including Zambia
31:48
but how will valet deal with
31:50
environmental concerns on this continent
31:53
the company is no stranger to
31:55
controversy in its home country of
31:57
Brazil despite fierce opposition from
32:00
environmentalists valet placed a mine in
32:03
the Amazon rainforest in its promotional
32:06
material the company explains that it
32:08
has put a great deal of effort into
32:10
repairing the damage it caused
32:38
but if actions speak louder than words
32:41
valets record is mixed the company has
32:45
been fined in several countries
32:46
including Brazil for illegal pollution
32:49
Canadian environmentalists are opposed
32:51
to a current plan by a valet to dump
32:54
almost 400,000 tons of what they say is
32:57
toxic waste from a nickel mine into a
33:00
freshwater lake they say valet is
33:03
refusing to build a much safer
33:05
containment facility in order to cut its
33:07
costs there is a you are in the
33:10
environmental department of valet we've
33:13
just seen a clip of the work that you're
33:15
doing in the environment environment
33:17
scenario how much of that is real and
33:19
how much of it is PR well a value we
33:21
have a lot of programs for environment
33:24
for project plans and the operations and
33:27
you consider a lot of specific actions
33:31
for each one we consider in
33:34
sustainability for special pillars you
33:39
moszer's social responsibility
33:44
environmental and health and safety we
33:47
respect our countries where Valley is is
33:51
that true though let's talk about the
33:53
waste from the nickel mine in Canada
33:56
that is going into a lake and the
33:59
argument day is that for you to build a
34:02
containment facility forward this waste
34:05
is going to cost you over 400 million
34:07
dollars you are choosing to use the lake
34:10
because it's a cheaper option for Valley
34:12
Inc and we nowadays we are implementing
34:16
a specific program for environment but
34:18
in the past is thus true the accusations
34:20
which we intend to correct
34:22
our missions there until 2018 and we
34:28
have a specific programs and new
34:30
technologies and we are sure we have
34:34
this complete program there we will
34:37
correct all all problems that we have
34:42
there I know that in Canada the law does
34:44
allow you a specific quantity of
34:46
emissions but why did you not just do
34:50
the right thing Valley has been active
34:51
in Canada only for several years now
34:54
so and in many countries are get on the
34:56
active for several years but what I can
34:58
say is that the stringency of the
34:59
environmental standards that exists in
35:01
Brazil is certainly something that
35:03
together with global standards World
35:05
Bank and others who contribute to this
35:07
we will apply and we apply it okay even
35:10
if it costs you a lot of money you will
35:11
do the right thing for the environment
35:12
we have no choice now to inversion let's
35:16
hear from environmentalists Petrus
35:18
encumber then we go if government does
35:21
not respect its policies now the same
35:23
problem
35:23
our ganas a chinois to cut two years ago
35:27
to above Ehrman to protection la fetch
35:32
and we went to court and won thirteen
35:35
point two million dollars on behalf of
35:37
government this government there is in
35:40
Supreme Court challenging us okay we
35:43
feel a fudge now how do you go to court
35:46
as government to challenge someone who
35:49
has the 115 point two million glass on
35:52
your behalf
36:06
so Minister how do you respond to that
36:08
you don't implement your own
36:10
environmental laws well I'm sorry I
36:15
can't discuss that much because I don't
36:18
know much about environment the only
36:21
thing that I deal with as far as
36:23
environment is concerned I'm always
36:25
fighting with environment people who say
36:28
you can't do the hotel there because you
36:29
are going to destroy the environment you
36:31
can't do the mind there because they're
36:33
going to destroy the environment my
36:35
answer is that if you are going to have
36:38
development obviously some destruction
36:40
to the environment is is inevitable but
36:43
what are the long-term the only thing is
36:44
that you're possible to be sensible
36:46
which I see other countries do is they
36:48
focus a lot on the mitigation factors to
36:53
protect the environment rather than
36:54
saying we can't have that investment
36:56
because the environment is not permit
37:00
I see cities in Europe for example they
37:02
are built along the rivers but here the
37:04
moment you want to build a Estonia the
37:06
river the environment people say are you
37:08
are going to destroy the environment of
37:10
course then you delay the jobs but
37:12
mining can be very environmentally
37:14
destructive or you can make sure that
37:16
the mind after when they finished leave
37:18
a decent place behind them well I think
37:20
I don't know these things
37:21
that's why I want to get in that debate
37:23
but Minister it is an important debate
37:25
considering that it is well documented
37:27
people have fallen ill because of the
37:29
actions of mind there is no point having
37:32
citizens that are sick and not and
37:34
cannot contribute to the economy so not
37:36
only mining and chasing the bottom line
37:38
but the well-being of the environment as
37:40
it affects the people is also important
37:42
I agree as I said I don't know much
37:45
about this thing but please remember so
37:48
sometimes the focusing on mining and
37:51
then forgetting that almost any other
37:54
type of economic activity has got these
37:56
hazards we have to be careful about that
37:59
because if you read today people say
38:01
these cellphones that you put in your
38:02
ears what do they bring they'll bring
38:05
cancer but I hear hardly ever hearing
38:07
but saying Oh
38:09
just after Nokia or this company because
38:11
of that so let's balance things out okay
38:13
all right comments from the audience do
38:15
you accept that you do you accept that
38:18
let's come here sir
38:20
Sixtus Mulenga from the mining industry
38:23
I think for Zambia mining has been very
38:28
positive it has it's been the driver of
38:32
our economy and as the minister and
38:35
wisdom tatty said we've gone through the
38:38
whole cycle we came from private to
38:41
nationalization and private and the good
38:44
news now is that we are wiser and we are
38:47
going to be the model for the world on
38:50
how the country can bring about
38:53
development for its people for its
38:56
benefit yeah so that's making you all
38:57
smile that's making over let's come the
39:00
side to you sir my name is Jimmy Longo
39:03
I'm a minor cray by the time the Zambian
39:08
government was privatizing the mines
39:11
from zcm to these other companies where
39:15
where our former colony widened british
39:20
company came companies came to come to
39:23
zambia and invest in these mines and
39:25
then them start being as transparent as
39:30
you want those companies to be thank
39:35
unfortunately I don't run Britain I
39:37
think it might be better if I did but
39:39
that's not my job
39:41
right at the back yes ma'am
39:43
I'm from civil society I have a very
39:46
quick question for honorable musaka Tony
39:48
I just wanted to find out of that we've
39:51
seen a lot of development projects and
39:53
we are being taught that the money is
39:55
coming from the mines and that Zambia is
39:57
getting a lot of mana formed from the
39:59
mines how much money are we getting from
40:01
their Minister how much money are you
40:03
getting from the mines the people have
40:05
heard the people have heard that there's
40:08
lots of money and Zambia is loaded well
40:12
this is a very long story I've explained
40:15
this on television several times so I'm
40:17
sure she can come and I can take her
40:19
through the figures and then tell her
40:22
what has happened so you're not making a
40:23
lot of money well we are making
40:25
reasonable money please again understand
40:28
this thing what is happening now after
40:31
privatisation it's like a farmer
40:33
planting a seed in the ground that's it
40:37
begins to grow the chyme comes when you
40:40
start harvesting now the issue that I
40:44
hear a lot about Zambia is that you see
40:46
these mining companies are not paying
40:48
enough taxes now if your mind is matured
40:51
like the way first quantum is today is
40:53
the single biggest pay of taxes in the
40:55
country because there's matured it has
40:58
come to the level where it can pay the
41:00
taxes but if we are going to have the
41:03
attitude where sample sinks are in the
41:05
ground today then tomorrow say you are
41:07
not paying enough taxes then we are
41:10
shooting ourselves in the fridge I like
41:12
a comment that came from somebody there
41:16
and I think what I'm looking forward to
41:19
is the examples of 60s malanga here and
41:23
many of these Zambians
41:25
who have had long years of experience in
41:27
the mining sector the next thing that we
41:29
want to see we want to assist these
41:32
people to get to the level where they
41:34
don't just know how to dig and produce
41:37
the copper but how they can make
41:39
projects go to the capital markets clear
41:42
to the mines because many of these
41:44
miners will come here they come value
41:46
too
41:46
but even the knowledge of how to go to
41:48
the capital markets to prepare their
41:50
documents and create the companies
41:52
that's what we want to see in these
41:54
people the experts so that's this debate
41:57
about you know foreigners and local dies
42:00
away which is about an issue of how I
42:02
can encourage investors whether they are
42:04
local or foreign especially local so
42:07
that they can begin to own these mines
42:21
society see the Zambian eiti report it
42:26
gives all the numbers of what the mining
42:28
companies are paying to the government
42:29
she can see that now okay then your
42:31
final thoughts clip well I think the
42:35
friend from the World Bank said
42:36
everyone's in favor of transparency yes
42:38
in theory but we have to get these
42:40
figures in front of the public and the
42:42
public have to both make sure the
42:44
companies pay and the government uses
42:46
the money well and there's a lot more to
42:47
do it's the people who will drive that
42:49
and they need the information in order
42:51
to do it you may not final thoughts I
42:53
like to register that there's been
42:57
benefit we have had benefits from
43:00
privatization in the case of Mopani at
43:04
the time of privatisation we only had
43:07
10,000 employees that rose by April 2008
43:12
to 20,000 employees the life of the our
43:16
mines have been extended at the time of
43:18
privatisation moflea only had five years
43:20
now we are talking about another ten
43:23
years from now and possibly longer in
43:25
the case of environment government
43:28
enacted a law some time back where each
43:31
mining company is going to make pro
43:34
visions towards the water core the
43:36
Environmental Protection Fund and we do
43:38
that on an annual basis let's come to
43:41
you and rule will end with you Steve I
43:44
have nothing against you I'll come to
43:46
you just a moment a few points the first
43:47
is that this issue of sustainability has
43:50
at least three components they are the
43:52
actions and sustainability of the
43:54
private investor it is the framework and
43:56
sustainability of the government and it
43:58
is the attitude and actions of the civil
44:01
society going forward there is no way
44:03
that we and serious investors and that
44:06
benefits can accrue to Africa or
44:08
anywhere if we do not work all three
44:10
together leaving rhetoric aside having a
44:12
long term objective and having this
44:15
dialogue and finally where we are right
44:18
here in Zambia we may be here 30 40
44:19
years if we have another mind we'll be
44:21
here 200 years but we certainly have the
44:23
outlook that the best legacy we can
44:26
leave in a mining company beyond the
44:29
profits that we generate for our
44:30
shareholders and is essential but it's
44:32
also that it's a platform for economic
44:34
diversification
44:35
there's GDP growth and there's GDP
44:37
diversification we need a lot more of
44:39
the latter to complement the former so
44:41
the way that we can contribute to that
44:43
to Zambia to Zambia's workers and to the
44:46
local situation here is something that
44:49
we have to know from day one and we have
44:50
to realize we do until year 30 and it's
44:53
unquestionable thank you very much
44:54
Andrew Steve mining benefited the
44:57
continent to those who say the revenues
45:00
are coming in and therefore my name is a
45:02
Western that happened to Zambia I want
45:04
to challenge them and especially the
45:05
government of Zambia to do a
45:07
cost-benefit analysis an analysis of the
45:10
cost of mining to the suit's environment
45:13
and society the displacements of people
45:15
and all that and you find that you are
45:17
not making much progress in Ghana is
45:19
studied by the Environmental Protection
45:20
Agency puts the cost of mining to the
45:23
environment alone at four percent of GDP
45:25
in fact another study by the World Bank
45:28
also on Ghana puts it at 10 percent of
45:30
GDP and if the economy is growing at 6%
45:32
it's up to you to make the judgment as
45:34
to whether or not you are growing in
45:36
your economy or not
45:41
well I think for me mining has been very
45:45
good to Zambia we saw in our country the
45:48
when the mining sector declines it was
45:51
clear to everybody in this country that
45:53
things were declining this is how even
45:56
social infrastructure was rotting
45:58
reverse lat and this evident to
46:01
everybody that this country is making
46:02
progress now the last point I want to
46:05
make you this and this is advice to you
46:07
colleagues from the NGOs your salaries
46:10
are normally paid by you know people
46:13
from the West and things like that so it
46:16
is fine for you you have yourself a
46:17
local churches not here I think most of
46:21
it comes from NGOs from Europe and
46:24
America and so forth so your size I pays
46:26
it's okay for you to say no mining but
46:29
you are paid the sorry generate better
46:32
for somebody else for exampie in' for
46:35
every other Zambian the chance of being
46:37
funded from outside is not there they
46:40
might find a job and this mining can
46:42
provide them a job why not
46:49
well that's it from me radhika v i would
46:51
like to thank the panel of course and
46:53
the audience and wherever you may be
46:55
watching or listening to the world
46:57
debate thank you for joining us back
47:43
you
