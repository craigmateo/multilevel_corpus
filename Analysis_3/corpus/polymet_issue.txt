Polymet Mining Issue -8th Congressional Debate

Moderator: Where do you stand on copper nickel mining? Can it be done safely? Do you have
00:04
any confidence in that at all? And ah ah ah Mr. Sandman, this is your big issue, we’ll
00:09
start with you Sir.
00:10
Ray Sandman: No, it cannot be done safely. Not at this time, and even though we do not
00:16
have the science for that. So I oppose that wholeheartedly because I know what it can
00:21
do. And what it will do. Just about a month ago, a mine up there in British Columbia broke
00:31
and dumped five billion gallons of toxic waste into the river. Now it’s the same technology
00:41
that the mining is proposing to make a containment field for that polluted water. But where they’re
00:49
looking at puttin it is already in a mine that is already leaking into the watershed.
00:55
So I don’t support that at all. But what I do support is ah the Northern Lights passenger
01:08
train. I think my opponents will agree, we need to get big money out of Congress. We
01:15
need to stop ah giving subsidies to the corporations. We need to have the corporations start paying
01:28
their darn taxes! Then we can redirect some of that funding into northern Minnesota. So
01:37
that we can go on with other projects that are less environmental ah deadly and we talk
01:47
about two to three hundred jobs. Northern Lights, they were talking about the other
01:53
day, thirteen thousand eight hundred jobs for the Eighth District. That’s something
01:59
to look at. They may be temporarily, but three four years down the road, maybe something
02:05
else will happen. We don’t need that mine up there. So.
02:11
Moderator: Thank you very very much. Representative Nolan, on precious metals mining, Sir.
02:16
Rick Nolan: Well, ah first of all I I grew up on the Iron Range, the Cuyuna Range. Mining
02:24
is a huge part of what we do and who we are. Our economy that’s been set up here is based
02:31
on timber, taconite, tourism. Nobody enjoys the Great Outdoors more than we do up here.
02:40
Our water, our forests, our lakes. We treasure them; that’s why we live here.
02:46
But I reject the argument that, because something has never been done before safely, that it
02:52
can’t be done. There was never an internal combustion engine. There was never a catalytic
02:57
converter or there was never a scrubber on a coal-fired power plant to scrub the sulfur
03:03
out of them. We didn’t have the scrubbers to take all the toxic waste out of our lakes
03:08
and our rivers and our streams. I submit, I submit that we now have the technology.
03:17
We now have the brainpower. All we have to have is the resolve and the will to do it
03:24
right.
03:25
And ah y’know on your right here, my opponent suggests we should do away with all these
03:31
EPA regulations and onerous rules. Rules and regulations, which by the way, have cleaned
03:38
up our air. And our water. And in little over one generation, increased life expectancy
03:44
in America from about forty-seven to about ninety. Maybe one of the greatest achievements
03:50
in the history of humanity. No, I submit that we must be compliant with good, sound environmental
03:58
rules and regulations. And we have the technology to move ahead with mining, ferrous and non-ferrous
04:05
mining. These are minerals that are badly needed. Ah it’s a huge part of our jobs,
04:10
our economy, our culture. And we need to protect our environment just as well. Because that
04:16
too is a critically essential part of our economy and our culture.
04:20
Moderator: Thank you very much. Mr. Mills, it sounds like there might be some common
04:24
ground here?
04:25
Stuart Mills: Ah, well uh not really. (Audience laughs) Y’know what, um, I’m for it. Ah,
04:30
y’know what, PolyMet, it’s amazingly well thought out. The science, the engineering
04:35
is there. After nine years, there’s no reason why we shouldn’t be going forward with it.
04:39
Obviously, Mr. Sandman is against it. And we’re not quite sure where Representative
04:43
Nolan is. In the last election cycle, he blasted Jeff Anderson and Representative Cravaack
04:49
for their support of the Strategic Minerals Act. And then went and voted for it. Ah Nathan
04:54
Ness in the Duluth News Tribune had a scathing guest editorial which outlined Rick Nolan’s.
05:01
Representative Nolan’s flip-flops. Also, most recently, in September in the Duluth
05:05
News Tribune, they were talking about how he is hedging his support of PolyMet. And
05:10
the Daily Kos did a scathing editorial complete with a video outlining Represen- Representative
05:17
Nolan’s flip-flops.
05:18
So, uh, we can he can say he’s for it right now. Ah, but where is he going to be tomorrow?
05:24
And y’know you can look, all this stuff is online, ah, it’s not really did not / did
05:30
too / did not / did too. Just go look it up for yourself. Thank you.
05:34
Moderator: Thank you. One minute, Mr. Sandman if you’d like.
05:40
Ray Sandman: We don’t have the science for cleanup when it happens. Simple as that. I
05:48
look at what’s happening now without the mine being there. We have the metal mercuries
05:53
that are in the water, in the fish already. One in ten babies here in northern Minnesota
05:59
show a higher elevated - elevation of that metal in their blood. Our babies! What will
06:07
happen when this happens? It’s not if – it’s WHEN. It’s WHEN IT HAPPENS. We, we are the
06:15
ones who are gonna suffer. Our children are the ones that’s are gonna suffer. Your grandchildren
06:20
– it won’t affect us right now. But you go down two generations, it will. And if their
06:28
record is so great, why are all the accidents happening with this type of mining around
06:35
the world? It is unsafe because we cannot take care of it when it happens. Thank you.
06:43
Moderator: Thank you. Congressman, one minute please.
06:46
Rick Nolan: Well, ah, I do support PolyMet. I have always supported PolyMet. I have always
06:51
supported mining. And I have always supported doing it the right way in compliance with
06:58
good clean air, water, health and safety standards. Now, obviously you (to SM) take issue with
07:04
the standards and you (to RS) take issue with the mining. My position has been consistent.
07:09
It has been clear. And you can say that’s being on both sides of the issue. And I would
07:14
say yeah, you’re darn right it is. I am for mining and I am for doing it the right
07:18
way.
07:19
And with regard to the technology: Minnesota’s been a leader in clean water technology. We
07:24
make some of the best high-pressure pumps through companies like Wanner Engineering,
07:29
we make some of the films that go into reverse osmosis, and (to RS) with regard to wild rice,
07:34
I’ve been pickin wild rice all my life. I picked rice this year.
07:38
(Unclear)
07:39
Rick Nolan: Yeah, it - the rice where I was wasn’t very good either, Skip.
07:41
Ray Sandman: laughs
07:42
Rick Nolan: But we got a few pounds. Ah, but you can take and PolyMet has said, “Give
07:47
us your standards. You want two hundred and fifty parts – ten parts – zero parts.
07:51
We’ll buy the pump, we’ll buy the filtration, and we’ll give you whatever standard you
07:55
feel is important to protect the water and protect the rice. We have the technology.
08:00
We have the know-how. We just have to have the political will.
08:03
Moderator: Thank you very much. Mr. Mills.
08:04
Stuart Mills: Ah, my rebuttal is simple. If anybody who wants to know the truth about
08:08
how Rick Nolan’s been on each side of the issue, and trying to walk the tightrope and
08:13
hedge, just go to Google. Just Google it, the information’s out there. The debate’s
08:17
over.
08:18
Moderator: Thank you gentlemen.
