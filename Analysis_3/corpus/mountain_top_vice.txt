Blowing Up Mountains: Destroying the Environment for Coal
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvKe2LYy5pk
we went down to West Virginia to take a
00:12
look at coal mining because instead of
00:14
going underground like they used to for
00:16
decades and generations they have a
00:19
whole new way of doing it that blew our
00:20
minds we're on our way up to Larry
00:25
Gibson's
00:26
he lives on this mountain and you'll see
00:29
his property just has an incredible view
00:33
of what's going on around here
00:35
by the way us being up here isn't
00:37
exactly what they've drilled about these
00:41
companies don't want people to know this
00:42
is going on the locals are kind of
00:46
screwed because this is how they make
00:48
their living so if they shoot their
00:51
mouths off too much they're shooting
00:53
themselves in the foot holy shit this is
01:04
the new way that we mined for coal
01:06
I could easily tell you we're in
01:09
Afghanistan and the mountains and we're
01:11
looking for Osama bin Laden and you'd
01:12
believe me
01:13
is the second most biodiverse area in
01:17
the world and unfortunately we need
01:21
what's under these mountains and we'll
01:23
do anything to get it
01:25
coal companies like to do mountaintop
01:28
removal because they can get more cold
01:30
quicker cheaper with less people
01:32
the bad part of that is it's an
01:34
environmental impact that it has on the
01:37
streams and the environment was used to
01:39
literally destroy the mountaintops and
01:41
the valleys below where a deep mines
01:44
does not when the old-timers mined coal
01:49
it was hard work but now there they mean
01:52
cold faster than me and can mine it so
01:57
they're taking the tops off the mountain
01:58
to get it faster when George Bush first
02:02
took office he said mind the cold
02:06
get the oil get the gas the company of
02:09
the country needs it so he just opened
02:12
the doors uses Pandora's Box coal is
02:16
also being sold to North Americans is
02:20
this beacon for self-sufficiency in
02:23
terms of a fossil fuel that we can
02:24
depend on but this is how we get it and
02:27
then you heat your homes with it but
02:31
those are things that happens under the
02:33
poet I you know under their noses ledge
02:36
they just don't realize what is at stake
02:39
here
02:40
and the coal covers goodbye I guess
02:45
every single mountain out there is
02:46
important to somebody to be retained and
02:49
it's in its original contour but mine is
02:52
what we do here in West Virginia and
02:54
it's something we do extremely well yeah
02:58
and there's there's no reason absolutely
03:00
I don't think there's any reason you
03:01
there shouldn't be probably taking
03:03
anything wrong
03:03
but to be frank I was just horrified of
03:06
this this form of mining where they just
03:09
kind of take away mountaintop and I'm
03:12
wondering what that impact is or or what
03:15
you consider the impact to be there's no
03:17
pretty way to mine coal you know Nature
03:21
has a remarkable way of healing itself
03:24
over time
03:27
so those are the out the West Virginia
03:32
which I will talk about and then what
03:35
you see at the prompt on the air it is
03:37
another level of unattended devastation
03:41
around here to the extent that a
03:43
mountain is removed a little bit of a
03:45
misnomer there we're removing that tops
03:48
and we're not removing the entire now so
03:53
how far down would you go for example
03:55
well sometimes it's the ground that a
03:57
little bit Excel usually sometimes it is
03:59
I hope sometimes it is technically a
04:04
Coal Association representatives I have
04:06
to say that so if you're interested in
04:08
the world looking like bars or flute oh
04:10
this is great place to start
04:19
hi I'm visiting you from Zebulon 5 a new
04:23
planet that Earth is conquering we're
04:25
currently blasting away to make room for
04:30
earth inhabitants luckily we can breathe
04:33
here and it looks just enough like West
04:37
Virginia to make you feel at home
04:46
we've been surface mining for 4050 years
04:50
so while we're here mining you know if
04:52
we can reconfigure and reclaim this land
04:55
to accommodate that post mind and use
04:58
it's going to be a win-win for everybody
05:01
right they're planning these things off
05:03
it's a win-win and I'm sure you've heard
05:06
of this you're getting land for an
05:09
airfield like things like an airfield or
05:11
a golf course or a shopping center can
05:14
be built on this planed land show us the
05:16
shopping centers on yeah I'm just
05:18
airports yeah ok show me the first it's
05:22
not there I don't care what Chris
05:23
Hamilton or anybody else is telling you
05:25
it's not true it is not true far is
05:29
growing back in a hundred years there's
05:31
no way there's no way let's say two or
05:33
three hundred two or three hundred years
05:35
I mean there's no way there's no way or
05:37
if you don't have topsoil there it's not
05:41
going to grow if you just go to graphics
05:43
right that deep you're out of the black
05:44
dirt you down in the yaaaa
05:46
yeah that just that deep from a distance
05:49
it looks like a green pasture beautiful
05:52
well they call it hydrocity got this big
05:54
hose like us in here now we can spray it
05:56
on those walls and it's some lush and
05:59
green and they would grow a more really
06:01
you just spread on us and make it grow
06:04
yeah and we don't grass on steroids
06:06
that's what we call but it's rock right
06:08
under it is it's a camouflage Kevin
06:11
Johnson applause this is it this is
06:14
Hydra seed and they spray the mountains
06:17
with this and then everything grows back
06:20
everything's fine it's magical pixie
06:23
dust it feels like mulched toilet paper
06:27
dyed green
06:29
there's little seeds in it I think I
06:31
can't even tell it looked just like it
06:34
used to trees and everything as you can
06:38
see that this is topsoil
06:43
really good topsoil and then once they
06:46
put this really good topsoil down you
06:48
can come anywhere around here and check
06:49
about yourself
06:50
it's done with respect and attention to
06:54
detail and then they spray it with green
06:56
toilet paper and everything's back to
07:00
normal
07:06
so nobody's losing nobody it's not
07:14
exactly surprising to find out that the
07:15
miners the mining companies don't get
07:17
along but who truly understand why and
07:20
how they don't get along you have to go
07:21
to the miners themselves on white land
07:26
retired coal miner disabled coal miner
07:28
live here all my life
07:30
fifty-seven years old I'm a radical or
07:33
redneck there next time this that you
07:36
know that because when they had the coal
07:38
mining wars you wore a red bandana
07:40
around your neck that way I can
07:43
recognize you guys those guys are behind
07:45
those bushes are our Union man they're
07:47
on my side their coal miners the cold
07:49
industrial estate has a horrible record
07:52
on human relation this in this
07:55
particular watershed here in 1913 1914
07:59
is a coal strike here they're trying to
08:01
unionize
08:01
the county head police they're the state
08:06
head state police there and when they
08:09
come by Holly Grove because the people
08:11
then kicked out is living in tents
08:12
instead city when they come by they open
08:14
up on them with a machine gun companies
08:17
dead down that's why this it's a hard
08:20
feelings towards coal companies they
08:22
just came up and shotgun people when
08:25
you're hired
08:26
you sign a quit slip you some slip it
08:30
says you quit it's not dated so when it
08:33
gets down to the point that you do
08:34
something that I don't like as a
08:37
cooperator I'll tell you some way
08:39
today's your last
08:41
why something wrong yeah you quit oh no
08:44
I quit
08:45
oh yeah here's your quit slip you sign
08:47
this and you do not have a leg to stand
08:49
on most people outside the state and
08:53
some four in the state don't realize the
08:55
history and it's the same pattern being
08:58
played over again at the end of every
09:03
shift I notice that you could actually
09:04
hear the mountain powering down and then
09:06
powering back up again and that's just
09:08
because coal mining around here is a
09:10
24-hour operation at the end of the day
09:13
shift the miners go to their local
09:14
watering hole so we follow them I love
09:18
the coal mine because it's it's
09:20
adrenaline rush
09:23
okay I brought her back from floor and I
09:26
said you know what I learned
09:27
take care of her job to take care of my
09:31
own things my daughter
09:33
other family and I love our blitz
09:36
like I didn't I didn't want to come into
09:39
this it just happened
09:40
I mean yeah the money was good and the
09:43
money was great
09:44
but the money's not worth nothing but
09:48
now I enjoy sugar oh do you think I like
09:57
there's a there's a picture on that well
10:00
yeah I'm home otters deserve $35 an hour
10:05
or more because they work their ass off
10:07
and without them the country would fail
10:09
so right now to me coal mining ISM is a
10:12
necessary evil and it's not it's not
10:15
it's not the miners that are the one
10:17
where the miners themselves are to that
10:20
you've met me we're not bad guys but
10:24
corporate American CEOs and people like
10:27
that they're going to want to make the
10:28
big dollars and we're just told if the
10:32
mines aren't so good if you've known
10:34
this for generations why don't you just
10:36
leave and go somewhere else and get a
10:38
job somewhere else I mean it's like if
10:40
you graduate high school we said we'll
10:41
give you job making $15 an hour minimize
10:44
you add medical dental vision above a
10:46
party people do or you can go do the cop
10:49
trying to do the pyogenes morris right
10:51
or go work at McDonald's what do you
10:53
want to do you love the minds do you
10:55
think they're just going to keep
10:56
leveling this whole area if we can let
11:00
if we let them know whether this whole
11:01
place you might feel bad about it
11:03
because you're worried about the
11:05
environment but you're still will cut
11:06
the top off this mountain because hey I
11:08
got eat yeah I've got shit I gotta do
11:17
you see that mansion on top of that
11:19
mountain yonder can you see that through
11:22
your camera not bad weird looking for
11:24
yeah top of the hill that mentioned a
11:26
third that's Don Blankenship's one of
11:28
his mansions right there because he is
11:33
knowingly I won't say intentionally but
11:37
he is knowingly endangered in the lives
11:39
of every man woman and child in this
11:41
area for miles and miles and miles I
11:43
don't know how he sleeps at night the
11:46
symbolism of that him up there and you
11:50
down here is remarkable just the
11:53
symbolism of that and that he has a
11:55
bird's eye view potentially of watching
11:57
everybody down here here gosh the way
11:59
there's more coal left in these
12:00
mountains than has been mined
12:02
he intended to buy all this property up
12:05
and he's trying he still intends to do
12:08
it for sit down if nest
12:09
to move all the people out here and then
12:12
start taking these mountains down step
12:13
by step I've spent 59 years here and I'm
12:16
not going no place unless he washes me
12:18
off I'm all tired I starting to talk
12:38
about Donna I started getting pretty
12:41
upset so I won't say too much you what
12:44
we have a rotten you know especially
12:47
kids have right as much as he does you
12:50
know what what is what is people like
12:54
that think that they can I don't know
13:03
it's like they don't care thing it's
13:07
like they don't care they go ahead and
13:09
and and kill us and let you know like my
13:15
kids here they're 14 and 15 you know
13:18
what what's going to happen to them we
13:21
have local residents who have legitimate
13:23
concerns and we have processes in
13:26
programs in place to try to deal with
13:28
those concerns and then we have we
13:31
also another portion of our population
13:35
who simply do not like money and would
13:39
just assume see it all be abolished or
13:42
are available whoever isn't selling in
13:46
women go superglue well I saw bosun both
13:49
in the committee room today okay so
13:57
we're at the where the West Virginia
14:00
legislature this is a subcommittee B and
14:04
this hearings going to deal with the
14:06
slurry injection into the mine shafts
14:13
after coal mines there's a lot of
14:15
leftover Rock and unusable materials as
14:19
well as chemicals from the coal mining
14:21
process the stuff's called coal slurry
14:23
and it gets pumped back into the
14:25
mountain it's legal the mining companies
14:29
claim is regulated and the citizens who
14:32
well water and drinking water is
14:33
contaminated claim is making them sick
14:36
basically what we do is we forget the
14:39
site's themselves we have
14:42
radius for groundwater surface which
14:44
will be prevented I think I could be
14:48
used
14:48
now you can't inject within a quarter of
14:57
a mile of a well or a municipality well
15:02
then I don't know if you were president
15:06
last meeting
15:08
we had several people who brought
15:10
samples of their water we've had huge
15:16
contaminants in it I think a lot of
15:19
people don't understand that you have to
15:22
maintain wellness like in your car a lot
15:25
of people just turn on the spigot and
15:27
they think it's going to work for them
15:29
when they had things like iron hydroxide
15:33
precipitate and other metals buildup in
15:35
their wells and every time they go out
15:38
and welcome Lane I tell people you need
15:41
to have a friend to level talk to your
15:43
fire partner come out flush you out a
15:44
couple years again are gonna blame on
15:48
somebody else they're not protecting one
15:50
I mean just like you know the
15:52
far-fetched notion that you're not
15:55
cleaning your wells out you know I've
15:57
never heard of that I have never ever
16:00
heard of like hey guys an idiot
16:02
you think I'll be on that yeah don't
16:04
even come on over here - if he wants a
16:06
piece of it but you know this guy's make
16:09
fun of your common sense
16:11
yeah maybe a common sense and where is
16:14
the the toxins coming from I mean if if
16:17
you have used your well for generations
16:22
and never had a problem with your well
16:25
water then all sudden that you get you
16:29
know toxic metals coming in your well
16:32
where did it come from why wasn't there
16:34
a hundred years ago but it's kind of odd
16:37
that someone nearby you is injecting
16:41
into the ground the same thing that's
16:43
coming into your well and your well has
16:44
been operational for generations seven
16:47
generations then to say you're not
16:48
cleaning your well out but you you was
16:51
there you heard those two gentlemen from
16:54
the DEP make the statement that they
16:57
could prove that nothing that had been
17:01
done in the mining industry had harmed
17:03
our drinking water it was just a band
17:06
outright lie they're killing people and
17:10
if somebody gets to do something to stop
17:12
it
17:15
protection agencies are supposed to be
17:17
helping you local government state
17:20
government federal government how this
17:24
just goes on for this long I guess it's
17:26
all acacia pile politics I'm waiting
17:30
it's been a year and a half now almost
17:33
two years I'm still waiting on a man
17:36
that worked for the DEP he's in charge
17:38
of the gang swill mining operation the
17:41
state whispering I'm still waiting for a
17:43
call back from him you've got to be
17:45
kidding no I'm not kidding and I've got
17:47
the number of calls that I called and
17:49
who I called who I talked to you truly
17:52
have no idea what goes on around here
17:53
things I want to say to you out get it
17:56
come to my mind then I forget it but the
17:58
doctor from New York they called me and
17:59
told me said I'm surprised you can talk
18:01
was misled as you've got in your brain
18:02
could you explain to me what's how this
18:06
is affecting your family don't look
18:08
physically Britney come in here tell me
18:15
you went to the doctor they wanted a
18:16
doctor say what do you say about the
18:19
knot on your cheek
18:22
that it can be infection it can be fluid
18:26
Sakura can be seized taking so what
18:28
what's good what do you got to do
18:32
you don't want you to go see nobody else
18:35
what kind of antibiotics did he give you
18:39
and I got a little boy he's 9 years old
18:42
from a time he was a child he's been on
18:44
antibiotics more than half of his life
18:47
because of this damn water and we didn't
18:50
know what was causing right there's what
18:54
I have to take on a daily basis to stay
18:56
alive now that's almost hard to believe
19:02
because I see this please yeah and I'm
19:11
not going to be here long because you
19:13
cannot live what's that many chemicals
19:15
in your body how does that make you feel
19:16
saying that oh well mister I'm just
19:20
telling you the truth I know I'm telling
19:22
you what a doctor told me don't plan on
19:25
being here long having to take that kind
19:27
of medicine I've got stacks these
19:30
tablets this is the amount of medicines
19:33
I take and I have to take them I'm not
19:34
take them because I want to take I want
19:36
to be alive for that little boy this is
19:40
what they claimed isn't happening yeah
19:41
the DEP and the EPA the EPA the mining
19:45
companies everybody who's not living in
19:48
these areas everybody's not a miner
19:49
acclaiming this isn't happen that's
19:52
right and this is your imagination
19:55
well you think every day before you go
19:57
to bed what do you pray before you go to
19:59
bed and you just ask God to take you
20:02
your family so you can't do because man
20:04
has done done the damage to the earth
20:06
and man I don't see how man can correct
20:11
what's been done God can handle this he
20:14
will when the right time comes he will
20:16
he will do what has to be done
