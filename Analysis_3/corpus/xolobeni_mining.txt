00:20
social worker and representing the NGO
00:23
sustaining the wild coast gentlemen
00:25
thank you for joining me
00:26
welcome to the program thank you yes in
00:30
- let me start with you
00:32
from our SMS question it seems more than
00:35
99% of our viewers who took part in this
00:38
are opposed to the mining the majority
00:41
of people that we've interviewed over
00:43
the years doing various programs on this
00:45
issue also seem to post it it's also the
00:48
idea I get looking in the general media
00:50
when you look at all of this how is it
00:54
possible how did it happen that you gave
00:57
the mining right I think if I understand
01:02
my frequence
01:03
correctly your question related to
01:06
mining the world coast I think it's very
01:09
misleading question why because the
01:12
world course is at least five or five
01:14
thousand kilometers long the area where
01:18
they've applied consisted of four blocks
01:22
we have allowed them we have granted
01:25
them right for one block now how do we
01:31
assess applications because I think
01:35
you're trying to teacher to bring
01:38
together comment of people are opposed
01:41
generally in the process of Licensing
01:45
when we license applications we look at
01:51
the company's technical ability
01:53
financial ability on plans with
01:56
environmental requirements we also look
01:59
with the compliance with social and
02:01
labor plan and the other side the fifth
02:04
element is compliance with my knife and
02:06
safety in the process
02:11
people are invited to comment on their
02:14
protections now to respond that 588
02:19
people have threatened SMSF said no I
02:22
don't know whether these people
02:24
participated in the consolidation
02:25
process so it becomes yes it is good for
02:29
the media it does not help us to take a
02:32
decision okay but let me let me stop
02:34
with it and first of all I don't think
02:38
it's misleading because it does refer to
02:41
one of the most pristine parts of the
02:44
wild coast at the same time you may be a
02:47
little bit misleading here in the sense
02:48
that yes you've given rights for one
02:50
block but at the same time the company
02:52
has the right to keep on prospecting
02:54
with the idea that the other blocks
02:56
along this coast may be added to this in
02:59
time
03:00
I think it's employer that do too to
03:02
emphasize that you said it may be so one
03:05
cannot be misleading with and maybe can
03:09
I in the sense I'm actually with just in
03:12
turn one respected I think it's a bit of
03:14
an oversimplification because you know
03:16
issues like mineral rights net on
03:18
decided by a democratic vote the mineral
03:22
rights are obviously something since the
03:24
planning charter is meant for the
03:27
country as a whole but what is the more
03:31
important question and it retired like
03:32
to us was just centers and then maybe
03:35
just to reflectable of my own experience
03:37
of two years working with the local
03:39
community in the September last year the
03:42
king and queen of the AMA ponder came to
03:44
a special and visa in the community
03:47
where and I was astonished I mean I went
03:51
in there thinking that there would be
03:52
people busting from all sorts of other
03:54
places to dilute the local opposition
03:58
and my interest in I have to say other
03:59
people directly affected who live on
04:02
that 22 kilometers as Lana do yes and at
04:06
that meeting to my astonishment there
04:09
were some two thousand people present
04:11
over they didn't take an SMS poll but
04:14
just from the interaction between the
04:15
king and queen and those people they
04:17
were overwhelmingly opposed to it
04:20
misinformed about it and please
04:24
for then their voices to be heard now
04:27
I've made a point of inviting the
04:30
Department of Energy Department and
04:32
Affairs and the mining company to come
04:33
in here for themselves because if you
04:36
ask me and I follower against mining the
04:38
wild coast that's also the wrong
04:40
question to ask me it's a question of
04:42
the fundamental human rights which in
04:45
this particular instance have been
04:47
grossly violated and the human rights
04:49
commission were there and they thought
04:51
and I'm not talking to myself read their
04:54
report and they say that there was an
04:57
overwhelmingly people were opposed it
04:59
and hadn't been affirmed the next
05:01
episode was when the Human Rights
05:03
Commission had to issue a ministerial
05:05
subpoena to the Department of
05:07
Environmental Affairs yourselves and
05:09
land affairs to submit documentation to
05:12
show that they were in compliance with
05:14
the legislation now I hadn't asked them
05:17
to do that all I had done on behalf of
05:19
my clients was to put before the Human
05:22
Rights Commission a four-page complaint
05:24
about violations that we allege of human
05:28
rights in the Constitution the
05:29
Eurovision chose to go a step further to
05:32
knowing how how incendiary that issue
05:35
was in the pond delay and historical
05:37
context to try and make sure that the
05:40
institutional structures and systems
05:41
were there to support the people my
05:44
clients have asked me mr. Russia to ask
05:47
you to please come and spend time with
05:51
them the way I've had to do for the last
05:53
two years and hear what they are trying
05:56
to say as you I think you are a social
06:03
worker for that community yes and you
06:07
you have been representing them in
06:10
representing I'm not a lawyer lawyers
06:13
represent us help the communities
06:15
articulate the owner let me use a
06:18
different word you have been speaking on
06:20
their behalf no I haven't I've been
06:22
facilitating their voices to be heard
06:25
okay yes yes exactly they'd use what you
06:30
are saying because whatever you are
06:31
saying otherwise you'd not be sitting
06:33
here the whole community would be
06:35
sitting here today if you are no there
06:36
would be affectionate if you're not
06:38
speaking on their behalf if you are not
06:40
facilitating so whatever table Center I
06:43
want exactly the bed food you didn't ask
06:47
me a question so as far as we are away
06:50
and we are concerned consultation has
06:54
taken place and I've read a number of
06:56
documents the debate is whether
06:58
consultation was sufficient or not okay
07:01
and you have also indicated that to you
07:04
indicator that you agreed with me that
07:06
in the licensing process it is not a
07:08
democratic decision who makes the
07:11
decision the in terms of the Act okay
07:14
without delegation it is the minister -
07:18
workman rosiness of minerals and energy
07:20
now if ministers delegated which in this
07:23
case it has been delegated to
07:25
director-general then the
07:26
director-general takes the decision in
07:28
the process as I indicated consultation
07:31
does take place in every consultation
07:33
that is Oh always a debate whether it
07:35
was sufficient or not and interestingly
07:37
enough those who are opposed say they
07:40
never consulted those who are in favor
07:42
they always say that they were consulted
07:44
and this is the debate that one engages
07:46
engages in so it is true that the the
07:51
community whether there are two groups
07:53
one was in support the other is not a
07:55
northern support if I can and for for
07:59
your for your information the manager is
08:01
going to it's not the first time that
08:03
the minister was there but the Manus is
08:05
going to that area on Friday and there
08:08
is a meeting yeah now we are aware that
08:11
and my clients asked the minister of
08:13
Environmental Affairs would also attend
08:15
and the minister of land affairs so that
08:17
they can be get some clarity from the
08:19
confusion that exists from our
08:21
government administration this is my my
08:23
next question is under the new AIA
08:27
system that we have in the country who
08:30
has the final say from an environmental
08:32
point of view is DME the watchdog for
08:36
the environment as well in a case like
08:37
this or or is deep the Department of
08:41
Environmental Affairs
08:42
do they still ever say and if there is
08:44
an opposing say between the two
08:46
departments who makes the final call
08:49
they think it's important to clarify the
08:53
NP RDA has not been amended yet so sorry
08:57
just mineral and Petroleum Resource
08:59
Development Act has not been amended yet
09:01
so we regulate in terms of what is
09:04
provided for in the law now in terms of
09:08
the licensing process including
09:09
environment the Menace of minerals and
09:12
energy is the final say it may change in
09:15
future but currently and I don't know
09:17
what your reference to a new system I
09:20
don't know what's it when is it possibly
09:22
this new system will come into effect
09:24
sometimes sometime in future but
09:27
currently the Menace of minerals and
09:31
energy is the final say now that's the
09:33
Menace of minerals and energy then
09:35
consult with other departments the
09:36
answer is yes but now this is a good
09:38
example of that of the danger of that
09:41
where the people who have to make the
09:44
decision is tend to gain from a decision
09:45
like this are also the people who have
09:48
to be the watchdog in a process like I
09:50
would 1 2 2 2 2 2 debate me on that
09:53
number one danger is your opinion yeah
09:59
number 2 who is going to who stands to
10:03
gain is it the minister because the
10:05
minister does not take a decision in a
10:07
private capacity the minister takes a
10:10
decision in official capacity so what is
10:13
the minister standing to gain well in a
10:15
matter of finances versus environment
10:17
for example it's a financial decision
10:19
the gain will be in the financial side
10:22
the loss will be on an environmental
10:23
side I mean we're talking here of a
10:25
stretch that lasts between two estuaries
10:27
how will you ever be able to
10:28
rehabilitate them we're talking an area
10:30
that has 200 endemic species how are we
10:32
going to put that back at him he has a
10:34
horrible history when it comes to
10:37
rehabilitation let's look at the brittle
10:39
copy so any of the other areas that
10:40
we've covered in the past yo yo you are
10:42
you are interfering us as a journalist I
10:45
thought I'd journalist I'm partial the
10:48
objective when you make up your inform
10:51
that we ruin so when you make
10:53
accusations as a journalist bring facts
10:56
I can
10:57
so we we're not attacking in journalism
10:59
so let's let's
11:01
less less and less less degree with you
11:04
away with effects as a journalist be
11:07
objective let the debate be between
11:10
myself and my my friend mr. Clark here
11:12
not with you as a journalist yeah I've
11:15
tried to get interviews with you on
11:16
numerous occasions I've only succeeded
11:18
on very few recover these stories are
11:21
informed about it but we do not get the
11:23
answers from danger I feel like this was
11:25
an interview on color bench right not on
11:26
we're having a success cannot reject any
11:29
for you getting to feel like a social
11:30
worker mediating in a marriage kinetic
11:32
charge and I don't want you to fall into
11:35
another role but I have to say also as a
11:37
social worker I've tried to keep
11:38
perspective and not to allow my own
11:41
feelings get involved but I have to say
11:43
as I've become involved and built
11:45
relations with the community it has been
11:48
extremely hard for me as map to stay
11:50
within my professional role as well
11:51
because it is outrageous but let me ask
11:56
you mr. stone why is MRC not speaking
12:01
out and explaining themselves and
12:03
leaving it to you and to supposition and
12:07
to guesswork because the the perception
12:11
is that Detroit momentum energy is more
12:15
scared of what Dinis going to MRC is
12:17
going to do to you then giving
12:19
accountability to the community and I
12:21
can tell you why they don't want to come
12:24
and speak to us because on Monday I was
12:26
interviewing a Induna who was telling me
12:29
how Patrick Caruso took a whole group of
12:33
people to Rich's bareMinerals to
12:35
persuade them and in the process of
12:38
driving up there he plied him with
12:40
liquor to the point that when he got to
12:43
Richards Bay he was completely Dougy way
12:46
and not compás means not able to
12:49
properly represent us to the story when
12:51
he got back now that was volunteer to me
12:54
I did not solicit it and if a mining
12:56
company claiming to be a catalyst for
12:58
social development is behaving like that
13:01
it's and promoting social ills and
13:04
alcohol abuse and that's just the
13:06
beginning you saw the program on Monday
13:08
of scorpion domani and his and how he
13:12
sought to speak out against what he
13:15
perceived
13:15
bribery and corruption he wasn't
13:19
unfortunately able to because Cristiano
13:21
I'm not wanting to get into speculation
13:24
as to all that but the fact of the
13:26
matter is we now have many other
13:27
community members who had lost not
13:29
coming forward do you see where it puts
13:31
the poor minister in the position she's
13:33
not going to face that community on
13:35
Friday and having to justify the fact
13:37
that she is dealing with the bunch of
13:39
crooks and manipulators and I'm prepared
13:43
to stand by that and under professional
13:45
scrutiny I think well they I'm here
13:49
speaking for dearly so as to why the
13:52
company doesn't want to come I don't
13:55
know about this give me good news yeah
13:57
there was a request for DME to come and
14:00
they count now in terms of way being
14:04
scared dear me
14:09
the decision that we have taken it's not
14:13
about the company so what it is MRC TM
14:20
TM always have a company we are not in
14:24
love with a company what DM is position
14:29
is is looking at that community and
14:32
asking ourselves at this stage what are
14:37
the available instruments that we have
14:39
that is going to assist us in
14:41
facilitating the eradication of poverty
14:44
number two DME has a position we're in a
14:50
country where we live where 50 percent
14:53
of our people are poor we are going to
14:56
try and make use of all the available
14:57
resources to assist us in addressing the
15:00
challenges that we face we do not have a
15:03
position or review that minding and any
15:08
other form of Geotourism is mutually
15:10
exclusive so we have not taken that
15:12
position we have not taken a position
15:14
that says because we have granted the
15:16
mining rights to a company therefore the
15:19
ad economic activity should not
15:20
exceeding the tourists will still come
15:22
even if you mind the dunes exerted you
15:25
say
15:26
if I don't want to help the tourism yeah
15:28
if they were there no absolutely no if
15:31
if they were not coming now if they were
15:35
not coming possibly for any other reason
15:37
they will not come in future if the
15:39
challenge is and I think this is where
15:41
when we engage in the debate over issues
15:45
it's important that we become
15:46
constructive both of us are interested
15:49
in addressing poverty the question for
15:51
us which tools are we going to use to
15:53
address that well the challenges for a
15:55
for example that how can we then use MRC
16:01
to facilitate the attraction of tourists
16:05
to that area
16:06
the question is dear me you have this
16:09
dog this instrument called social and
16:11
neighbor plan how do we then use that to
16:13
still attracting tourists to that area
16:16
but what has been happening is wherever
16:18
engaging we have not been consulted I'm
16:21
against Adam and we were not dealing
16:23
with the real issue the real issue in
16:24
that area is not about a mining right it
16:27
has been issued or ecotourism that may
16:29
take place they really should is proper
16:31
poverty how do we then address it
16:33
because even environmentalist you know
16:35
that you can protect trees you can
16:38
protect animals if people are poor they
16:41
are poor those animals those birds will
16:43
not be protected so the challenge that
16:45
we have is to say let's look back and
16:48
say if this is the debate that we are
16:51
confronted with and the main issue that
16:54
we have is poverty how do we address it
16:57
what instruments in areas on that sector
17:00
I would love to be able to and I have
17:02
tried I will aspect to number your cat
17:04
say your district manager we had a good
17:07
relationship going and I said look
17:09
please understand this is a highly
17:11
explosive issue how can I be facilitate
17:13
to generate light rather than heat I've
17:15
been a social worker for thirty years my
17:17
previous assignment was with the World
17:19
Health Organization where I went to
17:20
Somalia and Zimbabwe and places like
17:22
that I know what I'm talking about when
17:24
it comes to poverty and humanitarian
17:26
response you don't solve the problem by
17:29
having the likes of MRC and mr. caruso
17:32
another instance one of the the men in
17:36
the crisis committee you have actually
17:38
taken up and
17:39
a curious I learned that mr. Caruso is
17:42
actually trying to lure their wives into
17:45
a b ee partnership with him say to them
17:48
while you support john o'clock your
17:50
husband support John o'clock these got
17:53
nobody come support us so what is he
17:55
doing he's driving a wedge within the
17:57
families now what is that
17:58
I mean poverty is not just a material
18:00
condition and when you come to that
18:02
community they must be materially poor
18:04
but there's a sense of community
18:06
solidarity with each other which
18:08
overwhelms me and so as many people get
18:11
concerned about the but ended in a
18:13
biodiversity endemism my passion right
18:16
now is for the people they have shown
18:18
such generosity of spirit in welcoming
18:21
people and into the likes of mr. Caruso
18:23
coming in and actually wreaking havoc
18:26
now and it can't be allowed to happen
18:28
what what we left to do and if you have
18:31
seen dear me we're not focusing on the
18:34
company the the main issue for ours how
18:38
to address poverty and I've also
18:40
indicated to you we are not in love with
18:42
the company it's not about them it's how
18:46
it's about DNA wanting to find a tool
18:49
that is going to assist us in addressing
18:51
poverty if they are bad boys we have a
18:54
way in dealing with them so it this is
18:56
for essa this is not an answer yet I can
18:59
understand I'm a quick questioning does
19:01
that mean that when they get the mining
19:02
rights a we will sell it on to somebody
19:04
else that's the other concern that we
19:06
have unfortunately if they want to sell
19:09
they still have to come back to us so
19:11
can I just suggest you put some very
19:12
strict constraints on that set can I
19:14
make arrangements for the damage they've
19:16
done to the tourism industry is the
19:18
first obligation that they have put that
19:21
as a condition for them it's fine to say
19:25
that it's about poverty but it's also
19:27
about long term versus short term the
19:29
life of a mind like that as I understand
19:31
would be 22 years whereas the potential
19:35
from it's purely tourism on an unspoiled
19:38
stretch of land on which we running out
19:40
of this on this planet probably as a
19:42
much longer-term potential for income
19:46
and for solving problems like poverty so
19:49
have you made those calculations have
19:52
you taken them into
19:53
counting your decision I think what we
19:55
have to be very careful when we we make
19:59
long-term Pro projections number one
20:05
there were attempts in eco tourism
20:09
Ahmedabad ventures I don't know what it
20:12
is going I can very good so they did the
20:16
argument that they are long-term
20:20
sustaining ecotourism or whatever the
20:25
instrument that we are going to use is
20:27
business so are you suggesting I waive
20:30
international pause just be fun yes a
20:33
moment you let's let's go back to color
20:35
bed and I'll respond to that we are
20:38
using business we're using company to
20:41
argue that a company sustainable he is
20:45
is very misleading okay let's not
20:49
confuse a resource with a company yeah I
20:54
wasn't talking company I was knocking
20:56
the UHF connectors echoed to dismiss
20:58
Nora is not a resource you normally you
21:01
promote tourism through using a company
21:04
then this is untrue because companies
21:06
are liquidated so they debate of asset
21:09
and mining also go to you know at least
21:11
I know your argument was mining is short
21:14
term the others are long term so and I'm
21:16
trying to tell you I think we have to be
21:18
very careful I'm saying in 22 years
21:20
there'll be nothing left to mine in a
21:21
hundred years you're still there
21:22
waterfall but I think I've there were a
21:26
lot of waterfalls in in the individuals
21:29
around area and they are not there
21:30
anymore well as product actually faculty
21:32
I think let's see I'm trying to say
21:34
please when you when you ever you're
21:37
presenting arguments see one of the
21:40
challenges of being a human being we
21:42
always have this tendency of thinking
21:44
that what we think is the correct
21:45
approach now on Kruger National Park I
21:51
think you you are aware that there are
21:53
different classes or categories of parks
21:56
now in terms of existing law you cannot
22:00
mind in the quarry last so you are not
22:03
going to mind that so it's a very bad
22:05
example to
22:06
give but I think what I'm trying to show
22:09
you say is it wasn't a law you could
22:11
mind me
22:12
Oh the example I'm making I think is not
22:15
looking at is my mental side of this
22:17
balance sheet but there is a rule that
22:19
you can't man the Wild Coast had a
22:21
trolley car decrease is a very
22:22
hypothetical so you could plan to ask me
22:25
okay let's make it practically how final
22:28
is this decision of yours
22:29
to issue this right can it still be
22:30
reversed let's say there's a huge public
22:33
outcry let's say I bring you twenty
22:35
million signatures tomorrow what is
22:37
there any possibility of still reversing
22:40
this decision or is it fine my friend
22:42
John Clark has indicated to you that you
22:46
in the decision making is not democracy
22:48
so that is one person that takes this II
22:50
know it's in terms of constitutional now
22:53
in terms of the law then if the furnace
22:56
is if somebody's aggrieved so we have
22:59
the course number one because the
23:01
minister is not the one who took the
23:02
decision they can appeal the decision
23:04
okay if they then are not satisfied with
23:07
the ministers decision then they can go
23:09
to court where this is challenged in
23:11
court and as far as the decision is
23:14
concerned it is closed so you will not
23:16
be happy with the Director General
23:18
because of the 20 million signature goes
23:20
back and say I think I have to review it
23:22
cannot do it in terms of long but people
23:25
can appeal to the minister and and there
23:27
are there are there are organizations
23:30
that there intend doing so and then if
23:33
you fail with the minister then there is
23:34
a court if you fail in the High Court
23:37
you go to the appeal court and till you
23:39
go to the Constitutional Court but the
23:41
issue is not about we're not happy
23:43
because when you you say you're not
23:45
happy you okay you are not upon what
23:48
basis why is it at your you'll because
23:52
when we are arguing about human rights
23:55
the right to socio-economic development
23:58
is also human right so in the process of
24:00
me saying let's address the an a
24:04
medieval crisis committees concern how
24:07
do we then address the concern of those
24:09
who are in favor because they also have
24:11
human rights so this is and I think this
24:13
is we have to to have a sensible debate
24:16
and which is what we are not having we
24:18
need a little
24:19
filled yes which there has not been
24:21
because the same people that run our
24:23
Madiba adventures are the same people
24:25
employed by MRC for the mining I have
24:28
personal experience of taking people
24:30
down to intent to and seeing the women
24:33
who were there to serve us not having me
24:36
provided with food or anything despite
24:38
the fact we had paid in advance and
24:40
these women having to go to scrounge
24:42
around from the village to actually feed
24:44
us and they still did it
24:46
this is a life you'll see see the debate
24:50
here is we have misplaced the debate the
24:53
debate is around it justice did all of
24:56
us those of us who live in Janice bergna
24:59
and from time to time we want to get out
25:03
of this life we think about watching the
25:06
birds with our binoculars for four
25:10
people that is life and death and I
25:13
think as a social worker also there this
25:16
as you said you had no I think you in
25:18
the beginning you ask yourselves if you
25:20
were to ask me am i pro pro Oh against
25:23
mining and you didn't answer it because
25:25
yes your concern is development and your
25:28
concern is followed justice now for four
25:31
there are some of us who wear these
25:33
luxurious lives we we have our cars and
25:36
we think that the challenge there is
25:38
just about protecting the environment
25:41
and we say you will use that M pristine
25:44
poverty sensitive to and what we are
25:48
being requested to do is not to
25:50
juxtaposed to compare between protection
25:52
of birds against real life challenges
25:55
that people have and I don't think that
25:57
we should really be placed in the
26:00
position where we have to choose the
26:02
challenge in that area those of us who
26:04
have been there and I've been there
26:06
you cannot other South African except
26:10
that we engage in these luxurious
26:12
debates and the people's lives are the
26:15
ones at stake
26:16
yeah that's exactly what the big AG me
26:20
anyway gentlemen thank you very much
26:22
we've run out of time and I'm sure we
26:25
haven't run out of time on the completed
26:27
budget we'll be watching it will be
26:29
coming back to you will be saying
26:31
and what is happening as it happens some
26:34
people would be opposing it let's hope
26:36
not too much taxpayers money goes into
26:38
defending the court case we'll see what
26:40
time brings but gentlemen thank you very
26:42
much for the debate
26:43
I appreciate your presence here and
26:46
remember that it's time for our is amiss
26:48
question keep your pens and papers at
26:50
hand later on in the program I'll give
26:52
you the exact question and will make
26:54
sure that your voice is also heard even
26:57

27:00

27:03
outcome is
