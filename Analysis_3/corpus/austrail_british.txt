Cultural link between British mining town and Aboriginal Australia

one community lost its land independence
00:03
and identity when colonialists arrived
00:05
more than 200 years ago another lost
00:08
much of its identity in independence
00:11
when 30 years ago government action took
00:14
away that community's industry and
00:16
purpose but is a comparison between the
00:18
two too much of a stretch through nuts
00:22
well it was crazy actually I thought how
00:27
on earth is this gonna work the he is
00:30
Matthew Johnson a British academic who's
00:32
brought a group of people from a former
00:34
mining town in England to meet
00:35
Aboriginal people in Australia how do
00:38
their experiences compare if we are to
00:41
understand Aboriginal experience in
00:43
Australia we have to understand a
00:45
historical context of the UK which may
00:48
give Aboriginal Australian people cause
00:52
for thinking differently about white
00:53
people in general but they have
00:55
potential allies in different parts of
00:58
would you happen to be white some of
01:00
those in the north of England says
01:02
Johnson have suffered oppression and
01:03
discrimination on the basis of their
01:05
identity just as Aborigines have in
01:08
Australia now they share a stigma to as
01:10
recipients of handouts Carl Burton is
01:14
unemployed after a series of what he
01:16
describes as dead-end jobs worst part is
01:19
not wanting to be unemployed they wantin
01:22
wanting to earn your income instead of
01:25
going up and begging for Adobe fort load
01:28
what Burton learns from indigenous
01:30
australians and what they learned from
01:32
him will feed into the academic report
01:35
and now it's a completely different
01:37
situation but nevertheless there is
01:40
still impoverishment in the north of
01:44
England and how do those people cope
01:46
with it the British participants have
01:48
taken part in demonstrations calling for
01:51
indigenous rights and are being taken to
01:54
sites of cultural significance in June
01:56
the Aboriginal Australians will travel
01:59
to England for the other end of the
02:00
exchange the hope here is that if
02:03
parallels can be found when it comes to
02:04
the issues facing communities which on
02:06
the face of it have very little in
02:08
common then parallels can also be found
02:10
when it comes to solution
02:12
but one communities experience can
02:15
inspire the others the costs of this
02:18
exchange are being met by universities
02:20
and public grants but it's not a free
02:22
holiday says Johnson the exchange works
02:25
out cheaper than most academic
02:26
conferences and this is real life
02:28
research exploring cross-cultural
02:31
parallels with those on the sharp end of
