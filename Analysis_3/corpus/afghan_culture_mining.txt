Cultural Heritage and Extractive Mining in Afghanistan: Towards Sustainability
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6ewpjWYfYo
Afghanistan's cultural heritage is
00:22
fragile and not just from 30 years of
00:27
war in the 70s this mysterious fragment
00:31
of fortification was photographed Time
00:34
erosion reuse have all played a part
00:38
zoom down this narrow mountain pass will
00:41
come the heavy lorries of the mining
00:43
extraction industry a crucial resource
00:46
for the future of Afghanistan Afghans
00:49
are a proud people and the pride comes
00:52
from their past from their heritage
00:54
being a country that always function as
01:00
a point of transfer of knowledge ideas
01:03
and goods that's why you are the center
01:05
of the Silk Route we also on development
01:08
we want to also live in comfort and use
01:11
the national resources that have been
01:13
endured on these people but by Almighty
01:16
God this project is a strategic
01:18
partnership between UNESCO in the World
01:20
Bank in support of the Afghan government
01:23
to strike a balance between economic
01:25
development and protecting the cultural
01:27
heritage of the country
01:34
the sheer scale of the remains it's
01:36
messianic are staggering so much so that
01:38
saving messianic has become a cause
01:41
celeb on the world conservation stage
01:43
the Chinese mining company or the Afghan
01:46
government competes for being the
01:48
villain of the piece but of course the
01:50
reality is much more nuanced than that
01:53
in the beginning of course it was more
01:57
like we had the international group and
02:00
in a sea of information and culture at
02:03
that time I was the Deputy Minister of
02:05
Culture
02:05
it wasn't that bad but there was
02:08
misunderstanding between paurav so they
02:12
were acting like they have the side and
02:14
they were acting a day later outside the
02:16
whole goal is not that we have to finish
02:18
this side as an archaeologist it is my
02:22
duty to preserve my cultural heritage
02:24
but from the other side if you see you
02:29
can preserve it without a development
02:38
there has to be an understanding that
02:40
what is going to happen here the
02:42
eventual transformation of this site
02:44
into a major industrial area it has it
02:47
has actually enabled the world to
02:50
uncover one of the most magnificent
02:52
places that have been discovered in the
02:54
last decades what the archaeologists are
02:57
actually doing right now is trying to
02:59
understand the historical context of
03:02
this site and at the same time preserve
03:04
as much material as we are encountering
03:14
the the 3d modeling and the laser scan
03:18
which actually is going to prepare a
03:21
complete three dimension of the site in
03:24
order to model it in computers and have
03:27
not only the Afghan people to see it and
03:30
walk through it and and admire the the
03:33
contents of it but also for the
03:35
international community that cannot come
03:36
all the way to Afghanistan to have the
03:39
same experience
03:47
meanwhile a new approach has been taken
03:50
to other mining sites in a very proud of
03:54
the project it's a solid alliance a good
03:56
partnership that we have with the mining
04:00
industry in Afghanistan the Ministry of
04:02
Mines petroleum and the Ministry of
04:04
Information and culture working together
04:06
to try to preserve Afghan heritage once
04:10
the survey and the mapping is done at
04:14
that point then the government is will
04:16
be better informed to preserve Afghan

05:01
auditory Kira Jaffa is definitely a
05:05
partner of the World Bank and UNESCO in
05:09
the project and our aim is to work on
05:11
the archaeological review after of the
05:15
project so we are here to make the
05:17
illogical screening so find the site and
05:19
make an assessment on those sites in
05:22
order to protect them because we did win
05:25
the war bank UNESCO in US and the Afghan
05:28
government wanted to avoid an you may
05:30
say not get somewhere else well what's
05:31
the archaeological mapping and and
05:34
surveys completed and then the cultural
05:36
heritage that is there has been
05:38
identified that places the government in
05:42
a better position where they are able to
05:44
to design and implement a management
05:46
plan what to do with with with the with
05:49
the site itself and that would include
05:53
identifying the best methodologies
05:55
whether it be removal
05:58
remain in place or preservation of
06:02
artifacts that are there but mine is not
06:11
the only issue for therefore the
06:13
cultural heritage because if you have
06:15
mind will approach you will have
06:17
industries around you will have housing
06:19
for the workers so all those aspects
06:21
will also threat the control area touch
06:24
so we have to take in account not only
06:26
in proper minds area but a wider I have
06:28
a wide view of the area so for sure is
06:30
alike it's more about a general
06:32
landscape preservation not really about
06:35
the site itself because it's it's
06:37
inscribed on the World Heritage List and
06:40
the landscape may be affected by the
06:44
building of settlements for the mind
06:46
needed for the mind
06:57
mining has yet to start and the UNESCO
07:00
initiative has been busy mapping the
07:02
archaeological remains and working out
07:04
how to preserve the cultural heritage
07:06
the work starts with identification but
07:09
how do you identify areas that are
07:11
difficult to visit because they are
07:12
remote or for security reasons and to
07:15
get a wide view you need to stand back
07:18
the answer is satellite imagery the use
07:22
of satellite images is a big advance in
07:25
our work because there's many place
07:27
forced where for security reason we
07:29
cannot we cannot go and we cannot work
07:32
properly we decided to start our work
07:35
collecting different maps of Afghanistan
07:40
satellite images coming from different
07:43
sources and also aerial photo
07:45
photography so after that we start with
07:50
some of that - Arya we decide to create
07:54
a fish net and to work on this fish net
07:57
just looking in every one a kilometer
08:01
square looking for new sites this is a
08:13
living landscape and the big part of the
08:16
project is to preserve the environment
08:18
and economy for the people of the area
08:20
while benefiting Afghanistan as a whole

08:55
wars and men twenty forty years
08:59
what be Afghan has lost their we lost
09:02
our identity and I believe to give him
09:07
back that identity is only to culture
09:10
because when it comes to culture all
09:13
Afghans are united mama never said that
09:17
about Sonny and Chunkin house all about

mustn't ask what's good I'm more than I
09:33
enjoy meet any Mike she's their eyes
09:34
because I said yours bigger we remember
09:37
the cries of the Afghans over the
09:38
distraction of the Buddha statues in
09:40
Bamyan and nobody on earth is so much in
09:45
love with their heritage more than the
09:48
Afghans themselves so I assured
09:50
everybody who is concerned what
09:52
acknowledging they are concerned that
09:53
the citizens of Afghanistan each one of
09:57
them is a protectorate of the of their
10:00
heritage and we will not allow our
10:02
heritage to be stampeded by developing
10:07
agendas of unsustainable nature
