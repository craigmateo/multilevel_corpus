and the problem is that each of these
00:08
issues is being dealt with in a bitsy
00:11
kind of way there's labor issues there's
00:14
mechanization issues this there's this
00:16
there's this and is no coherent plan by
00:23
industry labor and the government to how
00:27
to manage these sorts of things the
00:29
other questions I'd like to kind of
00:31
bundle together in a way and answer in
00:34
terms of an analytical framework about
00:37
shareholder value maximization which was
00:43
mentioned in Gavin's article in The
00:46
Sunday Times on financialization and in
00:48
which sam Ashman it is a specialist in
00:52
and then this idea is that there's been
00:55
a process of change in economic logic
00:59
and a corporate logic where one of the
01:02
aspects which is termed financialisation
01:03
and one of the aspects of that is
01:06
maximizing returns to shareholders so
01:09
not retaining profit and investing that
01:12
it in a long term like manner and and we
01:15
haven't looked at this in its entirety
01:17
in this industry by any means but the
01:21
distribution was sort of extremely large
01:24
share of distribution to shareholders
01:27
even to the extent that is not very much
01:30
left over speaks to this idea of the
01:33
shareholder value maximization as does
01:36
things like Shayla buybacks and things
01:39
like that we need to try and work
01:42
together to compel the company to invest
01:45
in the community we need to work
01:50
together and I've said is this before
01:53
and I want to say it in this gathering
01:57
we must mobilize support for the workers
02:00
in this country not just the Platinum
02:03
workers just working for us because they
02:07
continue to be exploited they continue
02:10
to be oppressed even by the conditions
02:13
under which they work I think that we
02:16
this study is
02:18
enough and therefore it should inform
02:22
the way we want to help they work as a
02:27
particularly in the Platinum belt before
02:30
I've said to my own church we need to
02:34
disinvest from the mining companies
02:38
because they are not doing much to
02:41
improve the lot of the workers I think
02:44
it's about time that we take this route
02:47
now broader and say we must boycott all
02:51
products that come from the mining areas
02:55
church is a big investors workers
02:59
themselves a big investors universities
03:02
are big investors it has been done
03:04
before why don't we call for sanctions
03:08
now what has changed has a new
03:12
government really delivered for the
03:14
working class in this country if we were
03:17
to ask me I'd say no but we can force
03:21
them to begin to take the workers
03:23
seriously how embarrassing just the
03:26
other day that a workers leader was said
03:31
to have been paying his cattle minder
03:36
800 rents a month and the leader of the
03:40
Communist Party says the young man must
03:42
be very happy because is uneducated the
03:44
same language mr Griffiths used to
03:48
undermine the people that actually
03:52
produces the world
