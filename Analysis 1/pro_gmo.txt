Although genetically modified organisms (GMOs) are controversial, they have a few advantages. The following points will help you understand GMOs: 
Heavily tested: There have been a great number of studies tracking the effects of GMOs on animals. Overwhelmingly, these studies indicate that GMOs are safe to consume. 
Impact on farming: GMOs allow plants to be modified to grow in environments that would be normally inhospitable. 
Cheaper food: Easier farming means more food which, in turn, means less expensive food. This is not only beneficial for the average consumer, but it can have global implications. Less expensive food makes it easier to feed hungry populations around the world. 
Increased nutritional value: GMOs can be modified to have greater nutritional value than the organism would have naturally. For example, scientists, hoping to eliminate the need for post-harvest processing, have genetically modified rice to contain significantly higher amounts of vitamin A. This “golden rice” is not yet legal in most countries, but experts expect it to be within the next few years.

Agricultural biotechnology frequently asked questions 
Are GMOs to blame for the mass suicides of Indian farmers? 
"We find that the suicide rate for male Indian farmers is slightly lower than the non-farmer rate. And Indian suicide rates as a whole are not notably high in a global context. The pattern of changes in suicide rates over the last 15 years is consistent with a beneficial effect of Bt cotton, albeit not in every cotton-growing state. 
"Farmers are dying because Monsanto is making profits—by owning life that it never created but it pretends to create. That is why we need to reclaim the seed. That is why we need to get rid of the G.M.O.s. That is why we need to stop the patenting of life. 
Thousands of Indian farmers commit suicide each year — hundreds of thousands over the past three decades. The claims linking Monsanto, GM seeds and the globalization of the food supply to suicides emerged in the mid 2000s, promoted most aggressively by GMO critic and activist philosopher Vandana Shiva. During the past decade, claims of mass suicides of Indian farmers have been repeated often enough to become almost established fact in mainstream media outlets. 
But there is a wealth of evidence, including numerous academic studies, showing that India’s farmer suicide problem is not particularly high when compared to other countries and it’s not linked to India’s only approved GM crop Bt cotton, which is engineered to repel the pink bollworm. 
The suicide trend started in the 1980s — well before the 2002 introduction of GM seeds to that nation. Farmer suicides are also common in the developing and developed world, particularly in countries that are not growing GM crops. According to the World Health Organization, overall, male and female suicide rates in India are not notably high–they are lower for example than in France and Scotland, which cultivates no GM crops. 
Rates of farmer suicides in India, particularly among men, have gone down since the introduction of GM cotton. 
Researchers point to a range of causes for that nation’s suicide trends, including a poor agriculture infrastructure, the use of non-traditional credit sources and crushing debt for farmers with little in the way of a safety net following crop failures. 
Science and Politics 
It’s understandable why the alleged GMO link to farmer suicides in India has gained so much traction over the past decade. Two documentaries, Seeds of Suicide and Bitter Seeds, have spread the myth to a wider audience, highlighting gut-wrenching stories of farmers killing themselves by drinking pesticides. Celebrities promote the fears; in 2008, Prince Charles garnered headlines around the world when he publicized “the truly appalling and tragic rate of small farmer suicides in India, stemming in part from the failure of many GM crop varieties.” [“This kind of genetic modification takes mankind into realms that belong to God and God alone,” Charles wrote in the 1990s, when Europe was debating whether to approve GM cultivation and imports.] 
There has been a considerable amount of research showing that India’s farming suicides have been misrepresented and, sometimes, overstated by GMO opponents. The current trend, for example, started well before GMOs were introduced to India in 2002, as shown in this chart: 
But in India, anti-GMO activists have singled out a clear villain: Monsanto and its Bt cotton seeds. Shiva says the company is responsible for a genocide, claiming Monsanto has used its patent protections—which prevent farmers from saving and reusing their seeds — to ensnare farmers. Writing on her website, Shiva said: 
In less than two decades, cotton seed has been snatched from the hands of Indian farmers by Monsanto, displacing local varieties, introducing GMO Bt cotton seeds and coercing extravagant royalties from farmers. Since Monsanto’s entry into India in 1998, the price of cotton seeds has increased by almost 80,000%. 300,000 Indian farmers have committed suicide, trapped in vicious cycles of debt and crop failures, 84% of these suicides are attributed directly to Monsanto’s Bt cotton. 
Shiva is misrepresenting the data. Numerous studies have shown that Bt farmers spend at least 15 percent more on crops, but their pesticide costs are 50 percent lower. Since the seed was introduced, yields have increased by more than 150 percent. India, which had to import cotton two decades ago, now exports this lucrative crop. Suicide rates are lower for farmers than for non-farmers in India. Suicide rates in the most cotton rich provinces have fallen sharply with the introduction of Bt cotton, as the standard of living of farmers has risen. According to researcher Ian Plewis, a professor of social sciences at the University of Manchester: 
The balance of evidence favours the argument that adopting Bt cotton has increased yields in all cotton-growing states except Punjab, and has reduced pesticide costs so that the crop has become more profitable for farmers. So it’s reasonable to suppose that these farmers have reduced their debts and, to the extent that suicide has an economic component, are less at risk of committing suicide. 
Shiva also claims Monsanto controls the seed supply in India, preventing farmers from reusing them. Farmers buy the GM seeds because they have no other choices, or because they have been duped by Monsanto’s marketing campaigns. That’s not accurate. The Indian Farmers’ Rights Act of 2001 guarantees every person the right to “save, use, sow, resow, exchange, share, or sell” her seeds. Most farmers, though, even those with tiny fields, choose to buy newly bred seeds each year, whether genetically engineered or not, because they promise better yields and bigger profits. Upwards of 95 percent of India farmers have opted to use GM seeds since their introduction, making it one of the most successful embraces of GM crops in the world. 
A 2013 PLOS ONE study examined the economic effects of Bt cotton in India, where most farmers work small parcels of lands. The study showed an increase in the daily caloric intake of Indian farmers growing Bt cotton, indicating that income gains were providing better nutrition for the farmers’ families. 
The results of this research confirm that the income gains through Bt cotton adoption among smallholder farm households in India have positive impacts on food security and dietary quality. GM crops are not a panacea for the problems of hunger and malnutrition. Complex problems require multi-pronged solutions. But the evidence suggests that GM crops can be an important component in a broader food security strategy. 
So what is behind the spate of farmer suicides in India (and most countries around the world)? A 2011 report by the Center for Human Rights and Global Justice at New York University School of Law blames globalization for the problem. 
These farmers and their families are among the victims of India’s longstanding agrarian crisis. Economic reforms and the opening of Indian agriculture to the global market over the past two decades have increased costs, while reducing yields and profits for many farmers, to the point of great financial and emotional distress. As a result, smallholder farmers are often trapped in a cycle of debt. During a bad year, money from the sale of the cotton crop might not cover even the initial cost of the inputs, let alone suffice to pay the usurious interest on loans or provide adequate food or necessities for the family. Often the only way out is to take on more loans and buy more inputs, which in turn can lead to even greater debt. Indebtedness is a major and proximate cause of farmer suicides in India. Many farmers, ironically, take their lives by ingesting the very pesticide they went into debt to purchase. 
There are a number of studies (here, here and here) that point to a wide range of factors that have played a role in the incidences of suicides. In Factors Associated With the Farmer Suicide Crisis in India, researcher Dominic Merriott, of the U.K.’s Imperial College school of medicine, wrote: 
Determining a single defining cause for farmer suicides in India is impossible, especially considering the relative lack of detailed literature. What can be inferred is that an amalgamation of factors has led to a picture of large-scale farmer indebtedness, that combined with a volatile ecological climate and socioeconomic landscape has left hundreds of thousands, if not millions of farmers vulnerable to a situation of such crushing debt and desperation that many have come to take their own lives. The most discussed cause, Bt cotton, does not appear to be a significant factor, and notably there is little, if any suggestion that mental illness plays a role. Rather an agrarian crisis that manifests as a culmination of lack of agricultural investment and irrigation improvement, the increased use of noninstitutional credit sources (that appears to have increased since the neoliberal reforms of the 1990s), and likely to some extent the reduction of trade barriers appear to best explain the picture of farmer indebtedness and the acceleration of farmer suicides over the period. 
Journalist Keith Kloor examined the controversy in a 2014 piece, The GMO-Suicide Myth, in Issues in Science and Technology. 
As in much of the developing world, small-holder Indian farmers (those with less than two hectares of land) are most vulnerable to the vagaries of weather and climate change. They also have little access to institutional credit. As the World Bank has noted: “While India has a wide network of rural finance institutions, many of the rural poor remain excluded, due to inefficiencies in the formal finance institutions, the weak regulatory framework, high transaction costs, and risks associated with lending to agriculture.” Consequently, when purchasing seed, fertilizer, and other crop-related items, poor farmers often turn to private money lenders who charge high loan rates. 
The Takeaway 
It is disturbing to think that every half hour, a farmer in India (or in England or France for that matter) commits suicide. But, that number must be put into context, as explained by researcher Ian Plewis, a professor of social sciences at the University of Manchester. That figure, by itself, doesn’t explain much, particularly when you consider there are some 40 million Indian farmers in the nation’s cotton-growing states. 
The actual annual rate of farmer suicides (29 per 100,000, which is better than the suicide rate of non-farmers, at 35 per 100,000) offers a better perspective, Plewis said. The figure is worse than the rate found in England and Wales (12 per 100,000), but is about the same as the rates in Scotland and France. And further examination of the data in India shows considerable variance in the different cotton-growing states, and between males and females. 
The Indian farmer suicide story has become received wisdom for some anti-GM campaigners. In fact, we find that the suicide rate for male Indian farmers is slightly lower than the non-farmer rate. And Indian suicide rates as a whole are not notably high in a global context. The pattern of changes in suicide rates over the last 15 years is consistent with a beneficial effect of Bt cotton, albeit not in every cotton-growing state. 
Farmers, consumers and the environment all benefit from biotechnology. 
Benefits for Farmers 
Biotech traits are deployed in seed—primarily in corn and soybeans—to help farmers better manage their crops and improve their yield and profit potential. Traits provide crops with various benefits including protection against insects and disease; water optimization; and increased tolerance to heat, drought and other stressors. 
Benefits for Consumers 
Biotech crops generally require fewer inputs and resources than conventional crops, resulting in decreased food production costs and lower prices for consumers. Biotechnology helps reduce the price of crops like corn, soybeans and sugar beets by as much as 15‒30 percent. 
Debunking Common Myths 
Biotech crops are as safe as organic or conventional crops. The development of a commercial biotech trait from discovery to commercialization takes, on average, 13 years and more than $135 million. The regulatory process alone can take 5‒7 years to undergo the rigorous safety tests required. 
Each biotech crop is tested extensively to see if it is safe to grow, safe for the environment and safe to eat. 
Source: gmoanswers.com 
Every fruit, vegetable and grain found commercially today has been altered by humans. 
Source: gmoanswers.com 
In 2015, biotech crops helped farmers use 48.2 million fewer acres of land to produce the same amount of crops. 
FACT:Results from extensive testing have shown no risks to humans or animals. Biotech traits allow farmers to use sustainable farming practices, making biotech crops good for the environment. 
Regulatory Approval Process 
Before a biotech product is commercialized, it must be approved by the regulatory bodies of 60 countries and the European Commission. In the U.S., the federal government oversees the testing and study of biotech products with guidance from agencies such as the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Department of Health and Human Services' Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to ensure safety for growers, consumers and the environment.

Pest infestations, diseases and poor weather conditions may all significantly lower crop yields in developing countries. GM crops could address these problems, where other breeding techniques have failed. We consider a series of case studies: 
Insect / pest resistance 
Half the cotton grown in China in 2002 was genetically modified to produce a substance that is poisonous to the cotton bollworm, a pest that devastates many cotton crops. Farmers had previously applied the toxin directly by spraying the crops. The benefits of the ‘Bt cotton’ are a reduction in pesticide use, an increase in yields and profits, and health benefits for farm workers who often apply pesticides without protective clothing. 
Disease resistance 
Plants can be genetically modified to be resistant to bacterial, fungal or viral infestation. Examples include research on sweet potatoes to improve viral resistance and bananas modified to resist the Black Sigatoka fungus. Untreated, this fungus can reduce banana yields by as much as 70% but fungicides are expensive. 
Crops that can withstand environmental stresses 
(e.g. drought, heat, frost, acid or salty soil) 
A gene from a plant which can survive prolonged water stress in desert conditions has been introduced into rice. This allows rice to produce a sugar that protects the plant during dehydration, allowing it to survive periods of drought. 
Herbicide tolerance 
Plants can be genetically modified to be tolerant to a specific weedkiller. This allows farmers to control a wide range of weeds with less weedkiller while not affecting the modified crop. Herbicide tolerant crops are grown mainly in developed countries. However, recently they have been used in some developing countries. For example, more than 90% of soybeans grown in Argentina during 2002 were GM. 
Improved nutritional value 
Crops can be genetically modified to contain additional nutrients that are lacking from the diets of many people in developing countries. One example is Golden Rice, which has been modified to have enhanced levels of ß-carotene, in order to help to prevent vitamin A deficiency. 14 million children under five suffer clinically from this deficiency, which can cause childhood blindness. 
Biopharmaceuticals 
Plants could be genetically modified to produce vaccines or other medicines. Potatoes have been modified to produce edible vaccines against E. coli bacteria which cause diarrhoea. This would allow cheap and easy distribution of the vaccine, but research is still at a very early stage. 
Today’s GMO crops are developed with specific benefits in mind, both for the farmers who grow them and the consumers who purchase them. Some of those benefits include: 
Fewer inputs (like water or pesticides) needed to grow food, on less land than ever before. Drought resistant GMO crops and Bt crops (which allow farmers to use fewer to no pesticides) are two examples of how GE technology can be used by farmers to farm more sustainably, in ways that positively impact their communities. 
Crops that are genetically engineered to fight diseases are saving not only the foods we love, but the industries that grow them. Genetic engineering was used to save the Hawaiian Rainbow papaya from a deadly virus which threatened to wipe out the crop, and the industry. Today, the Florida citrus industry faces the same threat, and GMOs may be able to help. 
Herbicide tolerant crops allow farmers to use less or no-till farming methods. These methods of farming reduce nutrient runoff and soil erosion, which helps our rivers, and requires less irrigation because it retains additional soil moisture, all while maintaining the crops’ yield, safety and nutritional value. 
GMOs are taking on food waste. New potatoes that are genetically engineered to resist bruising during shipping and handling are coming onto the market, and new apples that resist browning when sliced will reduce food waste in the market and kitchen! 
Foods with enhanced nutritional profiles, both in the US and abroad. Today we have GMO soybean seeds that produce healthier soybean oils, eliminating trans fats and containing increased levels of Omega 3. Tomorrow we hope to have bananas in Uganda  that have up to six times as much Vitamin A, or Golden rice (rice that produces and accumulate Vitamin A) available to the millions of children who suffer from Vitamin A deficiency globally every year. 
These benefits and traits illustrate that biotechnology, conducted in a scientifically sound way, has the potential to provide more healthy and plentiful food for a growing world population. 
Here are scientists' views on how GM crops can help the environment (reducing the need for herbicides, pesticides), the farmer (pathogen resistance), and make it easier to feed the world (enhanced crops with vitamins). Critics of agricultural biotechnology say there are other, better options for solving these problems. 
President Emeritus, Boyce Thompson Institute for Plant Research at Cornell University read his interview 
We're just at the tip of the iceberg of an enormous number of things that will be technically possible to do with plants. Some folks are talking about how they are going to change the qualities of plants so that they'll be able to do bio-remediation and clean up toxic sites. To some extent, that is a viable technology and it's a sustainable way of dealing with complex issues. ... 
We're going to find more examples where [it's going to be much easier to] switch off a gene or an enzyme in a plant, or add some new component. [For instance], if we can just cut down the amount of lignin in the poplar trees that we're growing for paper pulp to make newspapers, [we'll get] less lignin contamination in streams and waterways. That makes a lot of sense. ... [Over time], the power of genetics--[which can provide] a sustainable modification of a biological resource--is going to be the much-preferred avenue over using cost-intensive industrial processes to do the same thing. Norman Borlaug, Ph.D. 
Distinguished Professor of International Agriculture, Texas A&M University 
... If we use high-yield technology, which we have done beautifully in the last 50 years, to increase the food that we need, we leave undisturbed vast tracts of marginal land which, if we opened to cultivation because of lack of rainfall or topography, would erode badly. They would become unproductive in a few years. Instead, [using] high-yield [agricultural practices] on the land [that is] best suited, you leave undisturbed many of these areas for wildlife habitat, for outdoor recreation, and for forestry. ... 
There are many other things. Stop to think what would happen to corn production if you could put a gene into it that will withstand 3 or 4 degrees of frost. Corn is one of the most sensitive--it and beans--to light frost. Then you could plant earlier in the spring, when moisture is more plentiful. ... It will increase yield. It will shift corn production to earlier planting. We are just seeing some of the first things that have been useful. Martina McGloughlin, Ph.D. 
Director, Biotechnology and Life Sciences Informatics Program, University of California-Davis read her interview 
[Why use the BT gene to modify crops?] ... 
Farmers are incredibly productive, but it does come at a price. There is a lot of contamination of soils and groundwater with the excess use of chemicals that are used to control weeds and insects and pests. So this was an obvious area that biotech could very quickly address issues of interest to the farming community. ... At that point in time, the biotech companies weren't thinking specifically of the consumer. They really were thinking of the farmer. ... 
Last year, 55 percent of all soybeans were genetically engineered for another type of resistance gene, and this was herbicide tolerance. What this herbicide tolerance gene does is allow a far more environmentally compatible herbicide--glyphosate--to be used to control weeds. ... A recent report from the U.S. National Food and Ag Council in Washington has shown that using herbicide-tolerant soybeans, there was a savings of $280 million by farmers in 1998. This allowed them to use just a single herbicide. They only had to spray if the weeds emerged. They didn't have to use multiple sprayings or pre-sprayings. Likewise, they didn't have to use complex cocktails of really pretty nasty herbicides. ... 
Take corn and cotton. What kind of pathogens attack these crops? 
The main pathogen, especially for corn, is European corn borer. That particular pathogen comes up through the stalk of the plant itself, and it's very difficult to get at because it's literally inside the stalk, and you really oftentimes don't realize you have a problem until the ears fall off. That's not very good for farmers, and there's no really good way of being able to control them right now, even using traditional chemical pesticides. 
With the BT gene in the corn itself, when the larvae eat [it], they are immediately affected. If you look at the two plants--the control plant and the engineered plant--it's like night and day. The control plant is just completely infected with the European corn borer. The BT plant is completely clean. Charles Margulis 
Farmers have been among the first beneficiaries [of BT crops]. A cotton farmer uses less pesticides and grows better cotton. He's saving his environment. How do you answer him? 
I would say that he's the exception rather than the rule. ... Even the biotech industry's own study on BT crops showed, at best, cotton farmers are seeing about a 12 percent decrease in chemical applications. ... Once those [insects that are resistant to BT] evolve, you're going to be stuck going back to that biotech company, either for more toxic chemicals or for the next generation of genetically engineered crops. They're going to be more and more costly, and keep you more and more dependent. 
It's the same kind of treadmill that farmers have seen from the pesticide industry for 50 years. The average life span of an agri-chemical is about 3 to 5 years. Then nature evolves, the chemical doesn't work anymore, and farmers have to go back to the company for the next greatest thing. ... Jeremy Rifkin 
I visited a farmer in the Midwest, and they just used two applications of Roundup Ready, one at the beginning of the season and one halfway through. Much less than they've ever used before. ... 
I know quite a few farmers all over the United States who have tried this and have said the opposite, that they have to use more herbicides, not less. The same holds true with BT. Monsanto says, "We're going to introduce a little gene into the plant that codes for a pesticide." Every cell of the plant is producing that pesticide, so the insect tries to eat the plant and dies when it tries to digest the material. Monsanto says, "This is a leap forward. We're ending pesticides, groundwater contamination." 
Well, yes and no. Yes, they're ending the use of pesticides. But now they're introducing more toxin than they ever introduced with pesticides. When you spray a pesticide, it's infrequent, it's periodic. When you are putting the same toxin in the form of a gene into the plant, that plant is producing that toxin 24/7, perpetually over millions of acres. ... A major study just came out in Science or Nature this year showing that when you introduce the gene for toxicity, it is going into the ground soil. ... Charles Arntzen, Ph.D. 
President Emeritus, Boyce Thompson Institute for Plant Research at Cornell University read his interview 
[With genetic engineering], we can put things like vitamin A into a rice plant. ... It's going to solve major problems in the developing world, as to [the] availability of food materials for good nutrition. 
[I know] a standard response is, "Well, they should just be eating more green leafy vegetables." I've been to India. I've stayed in a very nice hotel in [the] center [of] New Delhi. Families [are] living on the sidewalk on an old patch of blanket. ... They no longer have a little garden plot to grow their materials. They're stuck in a concrete jungle someplace [where] they don't have access to green leafy vegetables and they're living on a handful of rice every day. The Rockefeller Foundation and others [are] recognizing this, and they have focused on issues like [changing] the quality of that food that they do have available. ... Martina McGloughlin, Ph.D. 
Director, Biotechnology and Life Sciences Informatics Program, University of California-Davis read her interview 
Some environmental groups argue for a return to another way of life. "We have enough food. We just need to distribute it." They're not moved by your environmental arguments, and they're trying to escape from your Third World developing country arguments. 
It would be wonderful if we could all live in a bucolic Turner chocolate-box environment, where we all are back working on the earth, looking like a scene from American Gothic. But that's not a reality. ... The reality is, if you're going to look at the productivity that you could achieve by going back to zero-input agriculture, versus what you can achieve using biotech means, they just do not balance up. The costs would literally skyrocket. You can even see that today, with the cost of organic produce. ... 
Poor farmers in developing countries are organic farmers, and they don't want to be. [They'd rather have access to the new agricultural technologies.] 
It's very difficult for them. I always like to quote a researcher from Kenya. Florence Wambugu has said, "The real advantage of biotech is, it's package technology in the seed." You don't have to teach these farmers new culture practices. You don't have to get them to completely change the way they do farming. You just give them a seed, and that increases productivity in that seed itself. She said [that] for years people have tried to change cultural practices of these farmers, and it just hasn't worked. It has been a complete failure, because you have to modify infrastructure, you have to re-educate them as to how to modify their farming practices themselves. But with biotech, the technology is in a seed. All you have to do is give them the seed. 
At this stage, about 40 different countries are capable of producing these biotech products. They don't have to depend on the U.S. or First World countries to provide them with this technology. Jane Rissler, Ph.D. 
Senior Staff Scientist, Union of Concerned Scientists read her interview 
Some say the greatest beneficiaries of this technology will be people in the developing world. What do you make of these arguments? 
I think it's a ploy. It's a ploy to convince relatively well-to-do people in the industrialized world to approve of this technology. It's playing on the guilt of relatively well-off people, that somehow if they don't approve of this technology by agreeing to buy the products, the result will be people dying of starvation in the developing world. 
You don't believe this technology can help people in the developing world? 
The biggest problem behind hungry people is lack of money. It's not technology. There's plenty of food right now, and there're people starving. Putting vitamin A in rice, making high-protein corn, perhaps they have some value. But the better approach would be that people could buy food that would give a well balanced diet, instead of having to pile all the nutrients into one type of food or two types of food. So I don't think we ought to be deluded. Technology is not the obstacle to feeding people. It's poverty. ... 
How about the idea of edible vaccines? Do you not see any benefit? 
These are ideas that people have, and I think they have noble purposes. I think that the problems are more complicated. ... I don't mean to be disparaging of all these scientists who have really noble goals. But I do see people perhaps overlooking more practical but less sensational solutions to very important problems. ... It seems the sexy thing to do, to apply biotechnology to a range of problems, without really considering that there may be simple, practical, feasible alternatives. Charles Margulis 
Some people in the developing world, scientists, [support the development of genetically modified foods]. It's not a fringe view [and Greenpeace will] have to deal with this constituency, which is more sympathetic than Monsanto. 
Monsanto and the biotech industry have used this as a public relations tool. There are certainly voices from everywhere in the world who will be supportive of biotechnology. But by and large, when it came down to their governments' representatives, the developing world was united in saying, "We want the right to say no to this technology." ... 
We live in a world today where 800 million people a year are going hungry, in a world that produces enough food for almost 9 billion people. Yet we only have 6 billion people on the planet. Why isn't that food being distributed more equitably? It's because people who can't afford to buy food simply aren't being given it. ... 
But people in these countries don't want to be just fed food. They want to grow their own. 
In almost every country in the world, there is enough productive growth right now to feed the population of that country. But many countries where people are going hungry are exporting food. That's because food gets sold for a profit. It doesn't get given away. And if people in that country can't afford to buy it, it's going to be grown and exported. 
In a Reddit "Ask Me Anything" thread on Tuesday, Bill Gates called genetically modified organisms "perfectly healthy." 
Gates also said he saw the breeding technique as an important tool in the fight to end world hunger and malnutrition. 
Though it may seem controversial, Gates' stance is in line with that of most scientists who study GMOs. 
Bill Gates has a message for those advocating against genetically modified organisms: I'm disappointed. 
In a Reddit "Ask Me Anything" thread on Tuesday, Gates said that not only does he view genetically modified foods as "perfectly healthy," but that he sees them as a promising tool in a wider array of resources in the fight to reduce world hunger. 
"GMO foods are perfectly healthy and the technique has the possibility to reduce starvation and malnutrition when it is reviewed in the right way," Gates wrote. "I don't stay away from non-GMO foods but it is disappointing that people view it as better." 
Gates' view may strike some as controversial, as many people think that genetically modified foods are dangerous. 
In recent years, companies have submitted more than 43,000 products to the Non-GMO Project, an organization that certifies products that don't contain genetically modified ingredients. And sales of such products are skyrocketing — today, they represent more than $22 billion in yearly sales, the organization says. 
But Gates' stance is in line with that of most scientists who study the topic. 
And nearly all the food we eat today has been genetically modified in some way. Dozens of crops, from corn to watermelon, have been selectively bred for thousands of years to give us the traits we find desirable, like large amounts of sweet, edible flesh, or small seeds. 
And many other products — some of them life-saving — might not exist without genetically modified ingredients. 
Insulin, the medication that people with diabetes depend on to regulate their blood sugar, is made with such ingredients, while the cotton used to make the shirt you're wearing was most likely genetically modified. 
Several experts say the "GMO" label does a disservice to the products made with genetically modified ingredients. The process of genetic modification is a breeding method, much like other recent advances in agriculture. 
"What are we labeling here, DNA?" Alison Van Eenennaam, a professor of animal genomics at the University of California at Davis, recently told Business Insider. "There's DNA in everything, so good luck with that." 
Cheaper GM Seeds Could Boost Adoption,
Farm Benefits and Company Profits:
The Case of Bt Cotton in Argentina
Vol. IV No. 1

2004

* Center for Development Research
(ZEF), Bonn, Germany
** University of California,
Berkeley, USA
This article analyzes adoption and
impacts of Bt cotton in Argentina
against the background of monopoly
pricing. Based on survey data, it is
shown that the technology significantly
reduces insecticide applications and
increases yields; however, these
advantages are curbed by the high
price charged for genetically modified
(GM) seeds. Studies show that
farmers’ average willingness to pay is
less than half the actual technology
price. A lower price would not only
increase benefits for growers, but could
also multiply company profits.

Matin Qaim* and Alain de Janvry**

Bt cotton is a GM crop into which a
gene of the soil bacterium Bacillus
thuringiensis has been transferred to
make it resistant to major
lepidopteran insect pests. It was
developed by the US company
Monsanto and, as one of the first
GM crop technologies, it became
commercially available in the mid1990s. Since then, the technology has
spread rapidly in the US, Australia, as
well as in several developing countries.
In Argentina, Bt cotton is patented by
Monsanto and was released in 1998
by Genética Mandiyú, a joint venture
between Monsanto, Delta and Pine
Land (D&PL), and the local company
Ciagro. Unlike other countries,
however, in Argentina the diffusion
of Bt cotton has been rather slow.
According to official statistics, four
years after its introduction, Bt
technology only covered about 5% of
the national cotton area (Table 1). This

is surprising, in particular when
compared to GM soybeans which
were adopted almost completely in
the country within a similar time
frame.
To better understand the low
adoption rates, an interview-based
survey of 299 cotton farms was
carried out in 2001 in collaboration
with Argentina’s Instituto Nacional de
Tecnología Agropecuaria (INTA). The
survey covered the two major cottongrowing provinces, Chaco and
Santiago del Estero, which together
account for 88% of the Argentine
cotton area. As the number of Bt
users is still comparatively small, we
employed a stratified random
sampling procedure, differentiating
between adopters and nonadopters
of the technology. The total sample
consists of 89 adopters (about 60%
of all adopters in the country) and

210 nonadopters. A check with
official statistics showed that the
subsample of nonadopters is
representative of the Argentine cotton
sector in terms of average farm sizes
and cultivation practices.
Apart from eliciting general farm,
household and contextual
characteristics, the survey included
detailed questions about input-output
relationships in cotton cultivation for
two growing seasons – 1999-2000
and 2000-2001. As all Bt adopters had
also cultivated at least some
conventional cotton, they were asked
the same questions for both their Bt
and conventional plots. Furthermore,
the questionnaire covered aspects of
farmers’ perceptions about Bt
technology.

Farm level effects of Bt cotton
To analyze the farm level effects of Bt
cotton in Argentina, we compare cost
of production and gross margins per
hectare with and without use of the
technology (Table 2). This analysis is
confined to the sub-sample of
adopters. That is, Bt and non-Bt plots

are compared on the same farms to
reduce a possible selection bias. As
expected, Bt technology cuts the
expenditure on insecticides. In 19992000, the average number of
insecticide applications was reduced
by 2.4, whereas in 2000-01, it was
reduced by 2.3. Moreover, there is a
significant increase in the yields that
farmers obtained: in both seasons the
yield gain is above 30%. Machinery
and labor costs are somewhat higher
on Bt plots. Although there is a slight
decrease in operating expenses for
pesticide applications, this is more
than offset by elevated harvesting
costs on account of higher yields.
Yet the most significant cost change is
due to seeds. Bt seeds add to total
production cost by one-third and
almost double expenditure for the
bundle of purchased inputs.
Altogether, average gross margins are
higher with Bt technology in 19992000 and 2000-01. However, there is
a big variance in the results. In both
seasons, around 40% of the Bt
adopters actually experienced a
decrease in gross margins.
Unsurprisingly, these are largely those
farmers who dropped out the
following year.

Compared with other countries where
Bt cotton is grown, farm-level
benefits in Argentina are rather small.
In the US, average per-hectare benefits
ranged between $50 and $80 in recent
years (Gianessi et al., 2002). For China,
Pray et al. (2002) reported gains of
over $400 for the 1999-2001 period,
and in Mexico, Traxler et al. (2001)
found average net benefits of $295
per hectare for 1997 and 1998. While
in these countries, the major advantage
of Bt technology is a drastic reduction
in pesticide expenditures, in Argentina
the main effect is an increase in
effective yields. The increase in total
production cost associated with Bt
intensifies the financial risk that
farmers face. Net benefits mainly
depend on extra revenues, which are
also a function of cotton prices. A
downward trend in world market
prices, as observed in recent years,
therefore lessens the technology’s
comparative advantage. Although
yield increases in Argentina were
similar in both growing seasons, the
absolute gain in gross margins was
much lower in 2000-01 because of
the decline in cotton prices. Lower
prices for Bt seeds could increase the
technology’s attractiveness from the
point of view of farmers. This is
reflected in the rising demand for Bt
seeds from the black market, which
are sold at around $35-40 per hectare.

Willingness to pay for Bt
cotton
Using a contingent valuation
approach, we estimated farmers’
willingness to pay (WTP) for Bt
cotton seeds. For the full sample, the
average WTP is $48, less than half the
actual market price of $103. Farmers’
price responsiveness is high: at $48,
the area under Bt technology in
Argentina would be around 250,000
ha, more than 10 times the area

actually planted in 2000-01. The
analysis also shows that larger farmers
are willing to pay more than smaller
ones. The mean WTP for minifundios
(less than 20 ha of land) is $38, for
small farms (20-90 ha) it is $52, and
for medium and large farms (more
than 90 ha) it is $83.

Company profit
It is obvious that net benefits for
farmers would increase with lower
prices for Bt seeds. But what about
the benefits for Genética Mandiyú, the
technology supplying joint venture?
Our study shows that the current price
for Bt cotton seeds is almost 80%
higher than the level that would
maximize the company’s profits. At
the profit-maximizing price level of
$58, profits could be about 3.6 times
higher than they are today, and we
predict a Bt cotton area of 184,000
hectares.

Conclusion
Given that the lepidopteran insect
pests which lend themselves for
control by Bt are important in
Argentina and that Bt farmers benefit
from increased yield and decreased
cost of insecticides, the issue of why
official adoption of Bt cotton has
stagnated at 5% deserves to be
addressed. Although the limited flow
of information was also identified as
an adoption constraint, the main
hurdle for wider dissemination is the
high price of Bt seeds. Farmers have
to pay around $103 per hectare,
which is more than double the total
cost that average cotton growers
spend on purchased inputs. In many
cases, the price markup outweighs the
monetary benefits. Subtracting the
actual seed cost from the total price
of $103 results in a $78 technology

The Global Knowledge Center on Crop
Biotechnology was established by the
International Service for the Acquisition
of Agri-biotech Applications (ISAAA)
in September 2000.
Co-located at the ISAAA Southeast Asia
headquarters in the Philippines, the
Knowledge Center envisions itself as
a virtual science-based information
network responding dynamically to the
needs of developing countries on crop
biotechnology and related issues.
“The Knowledge Center was born out
of an urgent need for developing
countries to have current authoritative
information for sound decisionmaking. This will be realized through
a network where consistent and
focused sharing and distribution of
information will be pursued.”

fee per hectare ($32 per acre), which is
the same as that charged for Bt cotton
in the US. However, agronomic and
socioeconomic circumstances are
different. The low-cost and subsidyfree production conditions in
Argentina lead to lower returns and a
lower value of Bt technology from
the farmers’ point of view. Therefore,
Bt seeds should be priced differently
in Argentina than in the US. Simulated
demand functions for Bt cotton
indicate that a lower technology fee
would not only increase adoption and
benefits for growers, but could also
multiply the profits of the monopolist
technology supplier. Reasons for the
sub-optimal pricing strategy are
unclear. But they might have to do
with pressure from the US farm
lobby, that fears competitive
disadvantages when US technologies
are marketed more cheaply abroad
than at home.

At Monsanto, when we say “GMO,” we’re talking about seeds. 
Our scientists work to identify genes that have the potential to benefit a plant grown by farmers. When they identify a potentially beneficial gene, plant scientists make a copy of the desired gene, and insert it into another plant. Each new GMO undergoes years of testing to ensure that it brings value to farmers and is as safe as the non-GMO counterpart—on average, it takes 13 years and costs $130 million to bring a GMO to market.

Benefits of Growing GMO Crops 
If you’re wondering why farmers have chosen to grow GMO crops, it helps to consider the challenges they face. 
Using Resources EfficientlySome GMO corn crops can protect harvests in water-limited conditions better than conventionally produced crops. Other GMOs can also promote the use of no-till farming, which keeps more moisture in the soil. No-till also enables farmers to make fewer passes through the field using machinery, which means less fuel used and greenhouse gases emitted. 
Fighting Pests and DiseaseScientists are developing crops that look and taste the same as their non-GMO counterparts, but are resistant to insects and plant-specific diseases that can impact a farmer’s harvest. Plants with traits that protect roots from insect damage have an additional benefit of using water more efficiently. 
Conserving Natural HabitatsGMO seeds can help farmers around the world meet the increasing demand for food by helping them make the most of their existing arable land, thus enabling them to preserve nearby habitats.

Are GMOs Safe? 
We place the highest priority on the safety of our products. 
GMO seeds have been safety tested more than any other crop in the history of agriculture. Regulatory authorities have concluded that GMO crops are as safe for humans, animals, and the environment as non-GMO crops. 
World Health Organization “GM foods currently available on the international market have passed safety assessments and are not likely to present risks for human health. In addition, no effects on human health have been shown as a result of the consumption of such foods by the general population in the countries where they have been approved.” 
National Academy of Sciences “...the study committee found no substantiated evidence of a difference in risks to human health between currently commercialized genetically engineered (GE) crops and conventionally bred crops, nor did it find conclusive cause-and-effect evidence of environmental problems from the GE crops.”

One of the main benefits that advocates of genetically modified (GM) food have promoted is its ability to help alleviate world hunger. In 2011, 160 million hectares of biotech crops were grown—that's 10% of earth's arable land, and it was an 8% increase than the previous year. 
The growth of biotech crops is the fastest growing segment in agriculture. While much of these crops are used for animal feed and biofuel, much of it also makes its way directly into a majority of processed foods sold in America and Asia. However, despite all the commercial success of GM crops, have they made a significant impact on world hunger? 
What Is Driving the GM Food Revolution 
The first GM food, the Flavr-Savr Tomato, reduced the cost to produce canned tomato products about 20% and numerous studies have shown an economic benefit for farmers planting GM crops. Even livestock can be raised less expensively, using feed made from GM crops as evidenced by the recent change in EU policy to help struggling farmers. Also, faster growth rates resulting in cheaper fish production is the main benefit touted for the AquaBounty salmon that may become the first GM animal approved to be sold as food. 
It's clear genetically engineered traits that make plants and animals more resistant to disease, stay ripe longer, and grow more robustly in a variety of conditions are effective in reducing costs and providing economic benefits to food producers. 
Of course, the companies, such as Monsanto, Syngenta, and Aventis, that produce GM crops also rake in profits, and opportunities for smaller start-up biotech companies, such as AquaBounty and Arctic Apples abound. There are good economic incentives for GM food development and production that drive the development of these genetically modified organisms (GMOs). 
GM Crops and Feeding More People 
Since they are cheaper to grow, increase yields, and extend the time food remains edible, it seems reasonable that GM plants should provide more food to a hungry world. However, it is not clear this is panning out as may have been naively anticipated several years ago. The countries that could benefit most from genetic engineering have benefited the least. 
Politics vs. Research and Distribution 
Much of the inability of GM technology to provide relief for the poorest nations seems to have less to do with the technology and more with social and political issues. Many of the poorest countries most strongly affected by famine, such as many African nations, have set up onerous regulations that prevent the growth and import of GM food and crops. 
Much of this resistance seems to be prompted by groups such as the African Center for Biosafety and SAFeAGE, and also from international relationships with Europe which has tight restrictions on GM food. Also, and partially as a result of the political and social situation, groups, such as HarvestPlus, that focus on research and development crops and farming techniques to address third world hunger specifically avoid genetic engineering as a method to improve plants. 
Anti-GM sentiment, though, is not the only reason it has failed to benefit the poorest nations. From the commercial side, major crop development companies use genetic engineering primarily to improve large cash crops with the most potential for profits, such as corn, cotton, soy, and wheat with. 
Little investment is put into crops, such as cassava, sorghum, millet, etc. which are more relevant for cultivation in poor nations. The economic incentive to develop the sort of GM crops that would help small, poor farmers in third world nations is small since the financial returns would be modest. Of course, anti-GM sentiment does nothing to ameliorate this bias. 
Using Genetic Engineering to Help Solve World Hunger 
OK, so let's just say it, the main driver pushing the development of GM crops is profits. Big agricultural companies, farmers, and food producers all want to make more money. These entities have benefited most from GM crops, and this incentive has certainly been helping move forward the development of the technology. 
Some might even say it the way it is supposed to work—capitalism driving innovation. That's a different debate, though, and profit-driven efforts certainly don't negate the possibility that the technology can also be applied to benefit society at large by reducing world hunger. However, it also doesn't mean it will. 
In fact, though, genetic engineering is a powerful tool for improving food production. There is no faster way to produce animals and plants with specific beneficial traits and, as we learn more about genetics, many more modifications will become possible. While this may scare many, the potential is also enormous and could play a role to improve the situation for the poorest in the world. 
Frankly, at this point, there is no question whether to apply genetic engineering toward improving crops for food consumption. Genetic modification is already part of the crop improvement toolbox. The real question is if, in addition to helping make many people wealthier in the industrialized world, this advanced technology provides part of the solution to help improve a lot of the poorest regions of the world. 
Applying this technology to safely and effectively solve the problems of third world hunger, though, would require reasonable engagement and coordination from a variety political and social groups, and that may be too much to hope for. 
About 3 million Americans suffer from peanut or tree nut allergies, which can cause hives, swelling of the throat and, sometimes, even death. 
But what if there were a way to make allergy-free peanuts? 
This could soon be a possibility, thanks to the genome editing technology CRISPR/Cas9, which provides a cheap and easy way to modify the genes of any organism. By tweaking the genes for the proteins that cause peanut allergies — which isn't easy to do — scientists might be able to create an allergy-free version of the popular snack food. 
And we could be eating these kinds of genetically modified crops in as few as five years, MIT Technology Review reports. 
The chemical company DuPont announced on Tuesday that is has made an agreement with Caribou Biosciences, a spin-off startup from the University of California, Berkeley lab of biochemist Jennifer Doudna, a CRISPR/Cas9 pioneer. 
In previous studies, scientists have used CRISPR/Cas9 to modify plants such as soybeans, rice, and potatoes in the lab. And in September, Japanese researchers used the technique to turn off genes in tomatoes that play a role in making the fruit ripen. 
DuPont claims it is already using CRISPR to grow drought-resistant corn and "hybrid" wheat plants (made by crossing two varieties of the crops) in greenhouses. And the company aims to start field trials of these crops as early as next spring. 
"We are talking about bringing products to market in five to 10 years," Neal Gutterson, vice president for agricultural biotechnology at Dupont's hybrid seed producer Pioneer Hi-Bred, told the Tech Review. "That is a pretty damn good timeline compared to other technology." 
A new kind of GMO? 
Genetically modified organisms (GMOs) are typically made by transferring genes from one type of species (e.g. bacteria) to another (plants) to make the recipient resistant to disease or drought, for example. With the new gene editing method, DuPont plans to only swap in genes from other varieties of the same plant. 
This is much faster than conventional breeding, which can take many years. 
The seed business, which is worth about $40 billion a year according to Tech Review, is dominated by companies like DuPont, Monsanto, Dow, and Syngenta. And these companies will have to invest millions more if they want to take advantage of the new CRISPR technology — money they think they can make back. 
These new genetically modified crops might face fewer regulations than typical GMOs. The USDA has said it won't regulate crops made with the new gene editing technology because it doesn't involve splicing in genes from another species. Europe, which has already taken some steps to ban GMOs, might take a different approach to CRISPR-modified plants. 
With lighter regulation in the US, some of these plants could be available much sooner, industry officials say. 
The global area planted to GM crops has consistently increased over the past years.  Substantial share of GM crops has been grown in developed countries. In the last few years, however, there has been a consistent increase in the number of hectares being planted to GM crops in the developing world. Fifty three percent (53%) or 100.6 million hectares of the total global GM crop area of 189.8 million hectares, is now being grown in developing countries. A significant increase in GM crop area was reported in developing countries of Africa, Asia, and Latin America.  Experiences from these countries show that resource-poor farmers can also benefit from this technology. 
This Pocket K documents some of the GM crop experiences of selected developing countries. 
Global Impact of GM Crops 
Farm IncomeBiotech crops have had a positive impact on farm income worldwide due to enhanced productivity and efficiency gains. In 2016, direct global farm income benefit was $18.2 billion. Over the period of 21 years between 1996-2016, farm incomes have increased by $186.1 billion.1

Pesticide UseSince 1996, farmers planting biotech crops have reduced pesticide inputs in their fields by 8.2% or 671.2 million kg which led to an overall reduction in the environmental footprint of biotech crops by 18.4%. Environmental footprint is a measure of the effect or impact a product, process, operation, an individual or corporation places on the environment, in this case, measuring the environmental effects of pesticides. 
The largest environmental gain was recognized with the use of GM insect resistant (IR) technology. GM IR cotton alone contributed a 43% reduction in the total volume of active ingredient used on GM crops and a 32.3% reduction in the total field Environmental Impact Quotient (EIQ). Adoption of GM IR maize also caused significant reductions in insecticide use (92.1 million kg of active ingredient), with associated environmental benefits.1

Developed Country Experiences 
Several studies on GM crop adoption in North America and elsewhere highlighted the multiple benefits derived from GM crops. Examples are the following: 
United States 
An estimate cost savings by farmers planting HT soybean was $73.1/ha in 2016, which is almost three times higher compared to the early years of adoption. The annual total national farm income benefit from HT soybean has dramatically risen from $5 million in 1996, to approximately $159.8 million in 2016.1 
The adoption of herbicide tolerant maize, which was slower in previous years, has accelerated, reaching 90 percent of U.S. corn acreage in 2018.5,1 
The total farm income benefits from 1996 to 2016 was $79,513.3 million.1 
Canada 
HT canola has boosted the total canola production in Canada by almost 11% in 2016. Adopters of biotech canola earned $473 million in 2016.1 
The additional increase in farm income by HT maize farmers in 2016 was $23.7 million.1 
Canada is estimated to have enhanced farm income from biotech crops by $8.03 billion in the period 1996 to 2016.1 
Spain 
Bt maize adoption in Spain in 2016 resulted in yield increases of 6.3% on average, the net impact on gross margin was $182.1 per hectare.1 
Farmers also experienced savings on pesticide use by $7.09/ha.1 
Australia 
For 2016, Australian farmers planting IR cotton have significant cost savings of about $223.05/ha despite the high cost of technology.  In 2015, net farm income at the national level was $103.74 million.1 
Developing Country Experiences 
Bt cotton adoption in India Cotton is a very important crop for India. However, due to the high incidence of pests, especially the cotton bollworms, India falls short of the world’s average yield of cotton by 48%, an equivalent of 280 kg/ha2. Indian farmers often lose up to 50-60% of their crop to the cotton bollworm.10 With the commercialization of Bt cotton in India in 2002, the cyclic infestation of bollworm has been suppressed. 
In 2017, Indian farmers planted biotech cotton on 11.4 million hectares, which is equal to 92% of the total cotton area grown in the country.2 Adoption of Bt cotton started in 2002 with 3 hybrids planted in six Indian states: Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu. The single gene hybrids have achieved a near phasing out because of the dual gene cotton hybrids which provided additional protection to various insect pests. Dual gene hybrids have also helped cotton farmers to earn a higher profit through cost savings associated with fewer sprays and increased yield of 8-10% higher than single gene IR cotton hybrids.2 
Fifteen Years of Bt Cotton Adoption in India (2002-2016) 
Fourteen studies on the impact of Bt cotton were conducted from 1998 to 2013. The results showed that yield increased by about 31% and insecticide spraying reduced by 39%, which translate to 88% increase in profitability (US$250/ha). 
Qaim and Khouser (2013) conducted a study involving 1,431 farm households in India from 2002 to 2008 to investigate the effect of Bt cotton on farmers’ family income and food security. According to the findings, the adoption of Bt cotton has significantly improved calorie consumption and dietary quality, leading to increased family income. The technology reduced food insecurity by 15-20% among cotton-producing households. 
Bt Corn Adoption in the Philippines A common corn pest in the Philippines is the Asiatic corn borer, the cause of up to 80% of production losses. Across the country, corn yield levels averaged only 2.8 tons per hectare. The Philippine government approval of the commercial release of Bt corn marked the first time that a GM food/feed crop was ever approved for planting in Asia. Initial plantings of Bt corn for the first year commercialization (2003) covered more than 10,000 hectares. Together with other biotech corn varieties (herbicide tolerant and Bt/HT), the total hectarage in the wet and dry seasons in 2017 was estimated to be 642,000 hectares. 
Adoption of Bt corn in the Philippines provided the following benefits to small-scale farmers:2,4,6 
Yield advantage of about 14.3 to 34% over conventional corn hybrids 
Pesticide cost reduction of about $12-$15/ha 
Profit gain of PhP10,132/ha (US$180), with PhP168/ha savings in insecticide costs 
Increased net profitability by 4-7% during wet season, and 3-9% during dry season 
Premium price for Bt corn because of good quality grains 
In general, socio-economic studies on biotech corn confirmed that the technology has positive impact on small and resource-poor farmers and corn producers in the Philippines. 
Conclusion 
The increasing number of farmers who have grown GM crops both in the developed and developing countries is strong evidence of their advantages in agricultural production and value to farmers. After 22 years (1996-2017) of GM crop adoption, an accumulated hectarage of more than 2.339 billion hectares, were planted by 18 million farmers. This unprecedented high adoption rate reflects the trust and confidence of millions of farmers in crop biotechnology.11 Experiences of small farmers from India, the Philippines and other developing countries using GM crops clearly show that small farmers can also benefit from the technology. The most consistent observation from these countries is that growing GM crops is a profitable farming endeavor.

Global Status of Commercialized Biotech/GM Crops: 2012 
Biotech Crop hectares increased by an unprecedented 100-fold,from 1.7 million hectares in 1996, to 170 million hectares in 2012. 
Introduction 
This Executive Summary focuses on the 2012 biotech crop highlights, which are presented and discussed in detail in ISAAA Brief 44, Global Status of Commercialized Biotech/GM Crops: 2012, and dedicated to the 1 billion poor and hungry people and their survival. 
Biotech crops increase in 2012 for the 17th consecutive year 
A record 170.3 million hectares of biotech crops were grown globally in 2012, at an annual growth rate of 6%, up 10.3 million from 160 million hectares in 2011. 2012 was the 17th year of commercialization of biotech crops, 1996-2012, when growth continued after a remarkable 16 consecutive years of increases. 
Biotech crops fastest adopted crop technology 
2012 marked an unprecedented 100-fold increase in biotech crop hectarage from 1.7 million hectares in 1996 to 170 million hectares in 2012 – this makes biotech crops the fastest adopted crop technology in recent history – the reason – it delivers benefits. 
Millions of farmers elect to adopt biotech crops due to benefits they offer 
In the period 1996 to 2012, millions of farmers in ~30 countries worldwide, adopted biotech crops at unprecedented rates. The most compelling and credible testimony to biotech crops is that during the 17 year period 1996 to 2012, millions of farmers in ~30 countries worldwide, elected to make more than 100 million independent decisions to plant and replant an accumulated hectarage of more than 1.5 billion hectares – an area 50% larger than the total land mass of the US or China – there is one principal and overwhelming reason that underpins the trust and confidence of risk-averse farmers in biotechnology – biotech crops deliver substantial, and sustainable, socio-economic and environmental benefits. The 2011 study conducted in Europe confirmed that biotech crops are safe. 
28 countries grow biotech crops with the top ten each growing more than 1 million hectares 
Of the 28 countries which planted biotech crops in 2012, 20 were developing and 8 were industrial countries. This compares with 19 developing and 10 industrial in 2011. Thus there are three times as many developing countries growing biotech crops as there are industrial countries. See a listing of countries and hectarages in Table 1 and Figure 1. The top 10 countries each grew more than 1 million hectares providing a broad-based worldwide foundation for diversified growth in the future; in fact, the top nine each grew more than 2 million hectares. More than half the world’s population, 60% or ~4 billion people, live in the 28 countries planting biotech crops. 
Two new countries plant biotech crops and three countries did not offer biotech seed for purchase by farmers. 
Two new countries, Sudan (Bt cotton) and Cuba (Bt maize) planted biotech crops for the first time in 2012.  Germany and Sweden could not plant the biotech potato, Amflora because it ceased to be marketed; Poland discontinued planting Bt maize because of regulation inconsistencies in the interpretation of the law on planting approval between the EU and Poland; the EU maintains that all necessary approvals are already in place for planting whereas Poland does not. In 2012, Sudan became the fourth country in Africa, after South Africa, Burkina Faso and Egypt, to commercialize a biotech crop – biotech Bt cotton. A total of 20,000 hectares were planted in both rainfed areas and irrigated schemes. About 10,000 farmers were the initial beneficiaries who have an average of about 1-2.5 hectares of land. In a landmark event Cuba joined the group of countries planting biotech crops in 2012. For the first time, farmers in Cuba grew 3,000 hectares of hybrid Bt maize in a “regulated commercialization” initiative in which farmers seek permission to grow biotech maize commercially. The initiative is part of an ecologically sustainable pesticide-free program featuring biotech maize hybrids and mycorrhizal additives. The Bt maize, with resistance to the major pest, fall armyworm, was developed by the Havana-based Institute for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology (CIGB). 
Over 17 million farmers benefit from biotech crops 
In 2012, a record 17.3 million farmers, up 0.6 million from 2011, grew biotech crops – notably, over 90%, or over 15 million, were small resource-poor farmers in developing countries. Farmers are the masters of risk aversion and in 2012, 7.2 million small farmers in China and another 7.2 million small farmers in India, collectively planted a record ~15.0 million hectares of biotech crops. Bt cotton increased the income of farmers significantly by up to US$250 per hectare and also halved the number of insecticide sprays, thus reducing farmer exposure to pesticides. 
Developing countries plant more biotech crops than industrial countries 
For the first time, developing countries grew more, 52% of global biotech crops in 2012 than industrial countries at 48%. This is contrary to the prediction of critics who, prior to the commercialization of the technology in 1996, prematurely declared that biotech crops were only for industrial countries and would never be accepted and adopted by developing countries. In 2012, the growth rate for biotech crops was at least three times as fast and five times as large in developing countries, at 11% or 8.7 million hectares, versus 3% or 1.6 million hectares in industrial countries. During the period 1996-2011 cumulative economic benefits were high in developing countries at US$49.6 billion compared to US$48.6 billion generated by industrial countries. For 2011 alone, economic benefits for developing countries were higher at US$10.1 billion compared with US$9.6 billion for developed countries for a total of US$19.7 billion. 
Stacked traits occupied ~25% of the global 170 million hectares 
Stacked traits are an important feature of biotech crops – 13 countries planted biotech crops with two or more traits in 2012. Encouragingly, 10 were developing countries. Around 43.7 million hectares equivalent to 26% of the 170 million hectares were stacked in 2012, up from 42.2 million hectares or 26% of the 160 million hectares in 2011. 
The 5 lead biotech developing countries are China, India, Brazil, Argentina and South Africa – they grew 46% of global biotech crops, and have ~40% of world population 
The five lead developing countries in biotech crops are China and India in Asia, Brazil and Argentina in Latin America, and South Africa on the continent of Africa, collectively grew 78.2 million hectares (46% of global) and together represent ~40% of the global population of 7 billion, which could reach 10.1 billion by 2100. Remarkably, Africa alone could escalate from 1 billion today (~15% of global) to a possible high of 3.6 billion (~35% of global) by the end of this century in 2100 – global food security, exacerbated by high and unaffordable food prices, is a formidable challenge to which biotech crops can contribute but are not a panacea. 
Brazil, the engine of biotech crop growth 
Brazil ranks second only to the USA in biotech crop hectarage in the world, with 36.6 million hectares, and emerging as a global leader in biotech crops. For the fourth consecutive year, Brazil was the engine of growth globally in 2012, increasing its hectarage of biotech crops more than any other country in the world – a record 6.3 million hectare increase, equivalent to an impressive year-over-year increase of 21%. Brazil grows 21% of the global hectarage of 170 million hectares and is consolidating its position by consistently closing the gap with the US. A fast track approval system allows Brazil to approve events in a timely manner. Brazil has already approved the first stacked soybean with insect resistance and herbicide tolerance for commercialization in 2013. Notably, EMBRAPA, a public sector institution, with an annual budget of ~US$1 billion, gained approval to commercialize a home-grown biotech virus resistant bean, (rice and beans are the staples of Latin America) developed entirely with its own resources, thus demonstrating its impressive technical capacity to develop, deliver and deploy a new state-of-the art biotech crop. 
USA maintains leadership role and Canada grows record canola hectarage 
The US continued to be the lead producer of biotech crops globally with 69.5 million hectares, with an average adoption rate of ~90% across all biotech crops. Canada grew a record 8.4 million hectares of biotech canola at a record adoption rate of 97.5%. 
India and China continue to grow more Bt cotton 
India cultivated a record 10.8 million hectares of Bt cotton with an adoption rate of 93%, whilst 7.2 million small resource poor farmers in China grew 4.0 million hectares of Bt cotton with an adoption rate of 80%, cultivating on average, 0.5 hectare per farmer. India enhanced farm income from Bt cotton by US$12.6 billion in the period 2002 to 2011 and US$3.2 billion in 2011 alone. 
Progress in Africa 
Africa continued to make progress with South Africa increasing its biotech area by a record 0.6 million hectares to reach 2.9 million hectares; Sudan joined South Africa, Burkina Faso and Egypt, to bring the total number of African biotech countries to four. In South Africa the hectarage occupied by biotech crops in 2012 continued to increase for the 15th consecutive season, driven mainly by increased hectarage under maize and soybeans. The estimated total biotech crop area in 2012 was 2.9 million hectares, compared with 2.3 million hectares in 2011/2012, an impressive 26% annual increase in area. 
Five EU countries planted a record 129,071 hectares of biotech Bt maize, up 13% from 2011. Spain was by far the largest adopter planting 90% of the total Bt maize hectarage in the EU. 
Five EU countries (Spain, Portugal, Czechia, Slovakia and Romania) planted a record 129,071 hectares of biotech Bt maize, a substantial 13% increase over 2011, with Spain growing 90%, equivalent to 116,307 hectares of the total Bt maize hectarage in the EU. Spain had a record adoption rate of 30%. The planned approval in 2014, subject to clearance of a new biotech potato named “Fortuna” resistant to late blight, (the most important disease of potatoes), is potentially an important product, that can meet EU policy and environmental needs to make potato production more sustainable by reducing heavy fungicide applications and decreasing production losses estimated at up to US$1.5 billion annually in the EU alone, and US$7.5 billon worldwide. 
Biotech crops contribution to Food Security, Sustainability and Climate Change 
From 1996 to 2011, biotech crops contributed to Food Security, Sustainability and Climate Change by: increasing crop production valued at US$98.2 billion; providing a better environment, by saving 473 million kg a.i. of pesticides; in 2011 alone reducing CO2 emissions by 23.1 billion kg, equivalent to taking 10.2 million cars off the road; conserving biodiversity by saving 108.7 million hectares of land; and helped alleviate poverty by helping >15.0 million small farmers, and their families totalling >50 million people,  who are some of the poorest people in the world. Biotech crops are essential but are not a panacea and adherence to good farming practices such as rotations and resistance management, are a must for biotech crops as they are for conventional crops. 
Contribution of biotech crops to Sustainability 
Biotech crops are contributing to sustainability in the following five ways: 
•     Contributing to food, feed and fiber security and self sufficiency, including more affordable food, by increasing productivity and economic benefits sustainably at the farmer level 
Economic gains at the farm level of ~US$98.2 billion were generated globally by biotech crops during the sixteen year period 1996 to 2011, of which 51% were due to reduced production costs (less ploughing, fewer pesticide sprays and less labor) and 49% due to substantial yield gains of 328 million tons. The corresponding figures for 2011 alone was 78% of the total gain due to increased yield (equivalent to 50.2 million tons), and 22% due to lower cost of production (Brookes and Barfoot, 2013, Forthcoming). 
•     Conserving biodiversity, biotech crops are a land saving technology 
Biotech crops are a land-saving technology, capable of higher productivity on the current 1.5 billion hectares of arable land, and thereby can help preclude deforestation and protect biodiversity in forests and in other in-situ biodiversity sanctuaries. Approximately 13 million hectares of biodiversity – rich tropical forests, are lost in developing countries annually. If the 328 million tons of additional food, feed and fiber produced by biotech crops during the period 1996 to 2011 had not been produced by biotech crops, an additional 108.7 million hectares (Brookes and Barfoot, 2013, Forthcoming) of conventional crops would have been required to produce the same tonnage. Some of the additional 108.7 million hectares would probably have required fragile marginal lands, not suitable for crop production, to be ploughed, and for tropical forest, rich in biodiversity, to be felled to make way for slash and burn agriculture in developing countries, thereby destroying biodiversity. 
•     Contributing to the alleviation of poverty and hunger 
To-date, biotech cotton in developing countries such as China, India, Pakistan, Myanmar, Bolivia, Burkina Faso and South Africa have already made a significant contribution to the income of >15 million small resource-poor farmers in 2012; this can be enhanced significantly in the remaining 3 years of the second decade of commercialization, 2013 to 2015 principally with biotech cotton and maize. 
•     Reducing agriculture’s environmental footprint 
Conventional agriculture has impacted significantly on the environment, and biotechnology can be used to reduce the environmental footprint of agriculture. Progress to-date includes: a significant reduction in pesticides; saving on fossil fuels; decreasing CO2 emissions through no/less ploughing; and conserving soil and moisture by optimizing the practice of no till through application of herbicide tolerance. The accumulative reduction in pesticides for the period 1996 to 2011 was estimated at 473 million kilograms (kgs) of active ingredient (a.i.), a saving of 8.9% in pesticides, which is equivalent to an 18.3% reduction in the associated environmental impact of pesticide use on these crops, as measured by the Environmental Impact Quotient (EIQ) – a composite measure based on the various factors contributing to the net environmental impact of an individual active ingredient. The corresponding data for 2011 alone was a reduction of 37 million kgs a.i. (equivalent to a saving of 8.5% in pesticides) and a reduction of 22.8% in EIQ (Brookes and Barfoot, 2013, Forthcoming). 
Increasing efficiency of water usage will have a major impact on conservation and availability of water globally. Seventy percent of fresh water is currently used by agriculture globally, and this is obviously not sustainable in the future as the population increases by almost 30% to over 9 billion by 2050. The first biotech maize hybrids with a degree of drought tolerance are expected to be commercialized by 2013 in the USA, and the first tropical drought tolerant biotech maize is expected by ~2017 for sub-Saharan Africa. Drought tolerance is expected to have a major impact on more sustainable cropping systems worldwide, particularly in developing countries, where drought is more prevalent and severe than industrial countries. 
•     Helping mitigate climate change and reducing greenhouse gases 
The important and urgent concerns about the environment have implications for biotech crops, which contribute to a reduction of greenhouse gases and help mitigate climate change in two principal ways. First, permanent savings in carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions through reduced use of fossil-based fuels, associated with fewer insecticide and herbicide sprays; in 2011, this was an estimated saving of 1.9 billion kg of CO2, equivalent to reducing the number of cars on the roads by 0.8 million. Secondly, additional savings from conservation tillage (need for less or no ploughing facilitated by herbicide tolerant biotech crops) for biotech food, feed and fiber crops, led to an additional soil carbon sequestration equivalent in 2011 to 21.1 billion kg of CO2, or removing 9.4 million cars off the road. Thus in 2011, the combined permanent and additional savings through sequestration was equivalent to a saving of 23 billion kg of CO2 or removing 10.2 million cars from the road (Brookes and Barfoot, 2013, Forthcoming). 
Droughts, floods, and temperature changes are predicted to become more prevalent and more severe as we face the new challenges associated with climate change, and hence, there will be a need for faster crop improvement programs to develop varieties and hybrids that are well adapted to more rapid changes in climatic conditions. Several biotech crop tools, including tissue culture, diagnostics, genomics, molecular marker-assisted selection (MAS) and biotech crops can be used collectively for ‘speeding the breeding’ and help mitigate the effects of climate change. Biotech crops are already contributing to reducing CO2 emissions by precluding the need for ploughing a significant portion of cropped land, conserving soil, and particularly moisture, and reducing pesticide spraying as well as sequestering CO2. 
In summary, collectively the above five thrusts have already demonstrated the capacity of biotech crops to contribute to sustainability in a significant manner and for mitigating the formidable challenges associated with climate change and global warming; and the potential for the future is enormous. Biotech crops can increase productivity and income significantly, and hence, can serve as an engine of rural economic growth that can contribute to the alleviation of poverty for the world’s small and resource-poor farmers. 
Regulation of biotech crops 
The lack of appropriate, science-based and cost/time-effective regulatory systems continues to be the major constraint to adoption. Responsible, rigorous but not onerous, regulation is needed for small and poor developing countries. It is noteworthy, that on 6 November 2012, in California, USA, voters defeated Proposition 37, the proposed state petition on “Mandatory Labeling of Genetically Engineered Food Initiative” – the final result was No 53.7% and Yes 46.3%. 
Status of approved events for biotech crops 
While 28 countries planted commercialized biotech crops in 2012, an additional 31 countries totalling 59 have granted regulatory approvals for biotech crops for import, food and feed use and for release into the environment since 1996. A total of 2,497 regulatory approvals involving 25 GM crops and 319 GM events have been issued by competent authorities in 59 countries, of which 1,129 are for food use (direct use or processing), 813 are for feed use (direct use or processing) and 555 are for planting or release into the environment. Of the 59 countries with regulatory approvals, USA has the most number of events approved (196), followed by Japan (182), Canada (131), Mexico (122), Australia (92), South Korea (86), New Zealand (81), European Union (67 including approvals that have expired or under renewal process), Philippines (64), Taiwan (52) and South Africa (49). Maize has the most number of approved events (121 events in 23 countries), followed by cotton (48 events in 19 countries), potato (31 events in 10 countries), canola (30 events in 12 countries) and soybean (22 events in 24 countries). The event that has received the most number of regulatory approvals is the herbicide tolerant maize event NK603 (50 approvals in 22 countries + EU-27), followed by the herbicide tolerant soybean event GTS-40-3-2 (48 approvals in 24 countries + EU-27), insect resistant maize event MON810 (47 approvals in 22 countries + EU-27), insect resistant maize event Bt11 (43 approvals in 20 countries + EU-27), insect resistant cotton event MON531 (36 approvals in 17 countries + EU-27) and insect resistant cotton event MON1445 (31 approvals in 14 countries + EU-27). 
Global value of biotech seed alone was ~US$15 billion in 2012 
Global value of biotech seed alone was ~US$15 billion in 2012. A 2011 study estimated that the cost of discovery, development and authorization of a new biotech crop/trait is ~US$135 million. In 2012, the global market value of biotech crops, estimated by Cropnosis, was US$14.84 billion, (up from US$13.35 billion in 2011); this represents 23% of the US$64.62 billion global crop protection market in 2012, and 35% of the ~US$34 billion commercial seed market. The estimated global farm-gate revenues of the harvested commercial “end product” (the biotech grain and other harvested products) is more than ten times greater than the value of the biotech seed alone. 
Future Prospects 
Future prospects up to the MDG year of 2015 and beyond look encouraging. Several new developing countries are expected to plant biotech crops before 2015 led by Asia, and there is cautious optimism that Africa will be well-represented: the first biotech based drought tolerant maize planned for release in North America in 2013 and in Africa by ~2017; the first stacked soybean tolerant to herbicide and insect resistant will be planted in Brazil in 2013; subject to regulatory approval, Golden Rice could be released in the Philippines in 2013/2014; drought tolerant sugarcane is a possible candidate in Indonesia, and biotech maize in China with a potential of ~30 million hectares and for the future biotech rice which has an enormous potential to benefit up to 1 billion poor people in rice households in Asia alone. Biotech crops, whilst not a panacea, have the potential to make a substantial contribution to the 2015 MDG goal of cutting poverty in half, by optimizing crop productivity, which can be expedited by public-private sector partnerships, such as the WEMA project, supported in poor developing countries by the new generation of philanthropic foundations, such as the Gates and Buffet foundations. Observers are cautiously optimistic about the future with more modest annual gains predicted because of the already high rate of adoption in all the principal crops in mature markets in both developing and industrial countries. 
Drought in the USA in 2012 
The worst drought in 50 years impacted on crop production in the USA in 2012. The drought was estimated to have affected 26 of the 52 states, and covered at least 55% of the land area of the USA, which is almost 1 billion hectares. In comparison, the more severe Dust Bowl drought of 1934 covered almost 80% of the US land area. By the end of July 2012, drought and extreme heat had affected more than 1,000 counties in 29 states and they were designated natural disaster counties by USDA. As of July 2012, compared with the average year, 38% of the US maize crop had already been rated as poor and similarly 30% of soybean was rated poor. Given that the maize crop is the most important in the US valued at US$76.5 billion in 2011, losses for 2012 are expected to be substantial. The drought in Texas alone in 2011 was estimated to have cost US$7.6 billion and final losses for the drought of 2012 are likely to be much higher. Since US maize and US soybean exports represent 53% and 43% of global maize and soybean exports, respectively, the impact of the 2012 drought on international prices are likely to be significant. There is some comfort in the fact that global rice and wheat supplies were relatively plentiful in 2012 and the hope is that they will preclude a broad escalation of commodity prices as was the case in mid-2008. Maize is more vulnerable than soybean to price escalation because the shortfall in maize production could be exacerbated by the demand for maize for biofuel production in the US. 
Some preliminary advance estimates in July 2012 suggested that losses in the US soybean and maize area affected by drought could be as high as 30%, but reliable estimates will not be available until later. Some of the most recent estimates indicate that compared with 2011 yields the average for 2012 will be 21% less for maize and 12% less for soybeans. Preliminary estimates by USDA suggested that the 2012 drought would result in increases in food prices of 3 to 4% in 2013, with beef prices increasing by 4 to 5%. 
First biotech drought tolerant maize to be deployed in the US in 2013 
Drought tolerance conferred through biotech crops is viewed as the most important trait that will be commercialized in the second decade of commercialization, 2006 to 2015, and beyond, because it is, by far, the single most important constraint to increased productivity for crops worldwide. The first and most advanced drought tolerant biotech/transgenic maize, will be launched commercially by Monsanto in the USA in 2013. Notably, the same technology, has been donated by the technology developers, Monsanto and BASF, to a Private/Public sector partnership (WEMA) which hopes to release the first biotech drought tolerant maize as early as 2017 in sub-Saharan Africa where the need for drought tolerance is greatest. 
Global review of drought tolerance 
Given the pivotal importance of drought tolerance, ISAAA invited Dr. Greg O. Edmeades, former leader of the maize drought program at the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT), to contribute a timely global overview on the status of drought tolerance in maize, in both conventional and biotech approaches, in the private and public sector, and to discuss future prospects in the near, mid and long term. The contribution by Dr. Edmeades, “Progress in Achieving and Delivering Drought Tolerance in Maize -- An Update”, supported by key references, is included as a chapter in the full version of Brief 44, as well as an introductory chapter on drought to highlight the enormous global importance of the drought tolerance trait, which virtually no crop or farmer in the world can afford to be without. 
19 YEARS CONTINUED GROWTH, DIVERSITY AND BENEFITS: 
Growth 
In 2014, a record 181.5 million hectares of biotech crops were grown globally – an increase of 6 million hectares from 2013 and more than 100-fold gain since 1.7 million hectares were planted in 1996. 
More than 60 percent of the world’s population resides in the 28 countries planting biotech crops. Of these countries, 20 are developing and eight industrial. 
Eighteen million farmers planted biotech crops in 2014, 90 percent of whom were small, resource-poor farmers, representing some of the poorest people in the world. 
The United States continued to lead biotech crop production with 73.1 million hectares, an increase of 3 million hectares over 2013. This surpassed the growth rate of Brazil, which had recorded the highest year-to-year increase for the past five years and added 1.9 million hectares in 2014. 
Diversity 
More than 10 food and fiber crops are approved for commercial planting, ranging from major commodities like maize, soybean, and cotton, to fruits and vegetables such as papaya, eggplant and squash. 
Newly-approved crops in 2014 included food crops such as the Innate™ potato in the United States, vegetable Bt brinjal/eggplant in Bangladesh, and biotech sugarcane in Indonesia. 
Not only are the crops themselves diverse, but so are the issues they address. United in their ability to boost benefits to the consumer and increase crop productivity for farmers, traits include drought tolerance, insect and disease resistance, herbicide tolerance, increased nutrition and food quality. 
Benefits 
The latest provisional information for the period 1996 to 2013, provided by Brookes and Barfoot of PG Economics, indicates biotech crops continue to have  a significant, positive impact on food security, sustainability and climate change by: 
Increasing crop production valued at US$133 billion 
Saving approximately 500 million kg a.i. (active ingredient) of pesticides 
In 2013 alone, reducing CO2 emissions by 28 billion kg, equivalent to taking 12.4 million cars off the road for one year; compared to CO2 emission reductions equal to removing 11.8 million cars in 2012 
Helping to alleviate poverty for more than 16.5 million small farmers and their families, totaling 65 million people – some of the poorest in the world. 
A rigorous meta-analysis conducted by Klumper and Qaim (2014) from Europe analyzed nearly 150 published biotech crop studies using primary data from farm surveys or field trials worldwide and reconfirmed the environmental benefits of biotech crops. The analysis noted that, since 1995, GM technology has: 
Reduced chemical pesticide use 37 percent 
Increased crop yields 22 percent 
Increased farmer profits 68 percent 
Takeaway. The growth, diversity and benefits of biotech crops continue to evolve and they can make a significant contribution to feeding a growing population. As the fastest adopted crop technology in recent times, biotech crops are part of the solution to food security and climate change – very real problems both consumers and farmers face around the world. Whereas biotech crops are essential for global food security, they are not a panacea. Adherence to good farming practices such as rotations and resistance management are a must for biotech crops, just as they are for conventional crops. 
THE INTEGRAL ROLE OF PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS: 
Increased Crop Productivity and Expedited Delivery 
Aid agencies and foundations have established projects to donate and transfer biotech crop applications from the private and public sector in industrial countries for the benefit of small, resource-poor farmers in developing countries for the past decade. A few examples: 
One of the smallest and poverty-stricken countries in the world, Bangladesh, approved Bt brinjal/eggplant for planting in October 2013. Less than 100 days after approval, commercialization of the crop was initiated and 120 farmers planted 12 hectares of Bt brinjal in 2014. The strong political will and support from the government observed in this model sets the stage for other developing countries to follow suit. 
The Water Efficient Maize for Africa (WEMA) Project aims to deliver biotech-based drought tolerant maize to select African countries as early as 2017. Made possible by a public-private partnership, the technology is first targeted at  South Africa, followed by Kenya, Uganda, Mozambique and Tanzania. 
The donated technology, DroughtGard™ saw a 5.5-fold year-to-year increase in planted hectares in the United States in 2014. This represents strong farmer acceptance of the drought tolerant maize. 
Takeaway.Public-private partnerships continue to be successful for increasing crop productivity by developing and delivering approved products to the farmer. As evident in the success story of Bangladesh, “political will” and government support are essential to ensure available and approved technologies reach farmers quickly. 
BIOTECH CROPS IMPACT CONSUMERS AND FARMERS: 
New Approvals Reconfirm Benefits to Consumers 
The United States approved the Innate™ potato for cultivation in 2014. The potato will address consumer health and perception concerns, while also reducing food waste – an integral need to achieve food security. The Innate potato: 
Decreases potential for producing acrylamide (a potential carcinogen) when potatoes are cooked at high temperatures 
Will not discolor when peeled and has fewer bruising spots, increasing consumer satisfaction and precluding  up to 40 percent yield loss from bruising 
Increases shelf-life 
As the fourth most important food crop in the world, field trials of biotech potato are currently being conducted in Bangladesh, India and Indonesia to assess their resistance to late-blight disease, the cause of the 1845 Irish potato famine, in which one million people died. If successful, this technology will result in higher productivity and increase the quality of this important food staple to consumers’ tables. 
Approval of the Bt brinjal in Bangladesh and drought tolerant sugarcane in Indonesia also represents biotech crops filling the void of important foods needed in the countries. 
Takeaway. Through continuous research, development, acceptance and adoption, biotech crops have and will continue to address consumer concerns and needs ranging from nutritional value to aesthetic factors that impact purchasing decisions and address the problem of food waste. 
FACT # 1. 2014 was the 19th year of successful commercialization of biotech crops. 
Since the first plantings in 1996, an unprecedented cumulative hectarage of more than 1.8 billion hectares (more than 4 billion acres for the first time) have been successfully cultivated, equivalent to ~80% more than the total land mass of China or the United States. Biotech crop hectares were planted in 28 countries in 2014 and hectarage has increased more than 100-fold from 1.7 million hectares in 1996 to 181.5 million hectares in 2014 – a 6.3 million hectare increase compared to 5.0 million hectares in 2013 at an annual growth rate of between 3 to 4%. A 100-fold increase makes biotech crops the fastest adopted crop technology in recent times – the reason – they deliver benefits. Number of biotech countries has more than quadrupled from 6 in 1996 to 28 in 2014, up one from 2013. 
FACT # 2. Number of farmers planting biotech crops. 
In 2014, 18 million farmers, of which 90% were small and poor, planted a record 181 million hectares of biotech crops in 28 countries. Farmers are the masters of risk-aversion and improve productivity through sustainable intensification (confining cultivation to the 1.5 billion hectares of cropland, thereby saving the forests and biodiversity). Thus, 7.1 million small farmers in China and 7.7 million in India elected to plant over 15 million hectares of Bt cotton in 2014 because of the significant benefits it offers. Similarly in 2014, 415,000 small farmers in the Philippines benefited from biotech maize. 
FACT # 3. Strong political will allowed Bangladesh to commercialize Bt brinjal (eggplant) for the first time. 
Notably, Bangladesh, a small poor country with 150 million people, approved the prized vegetable Bt brinjal/eggplant on 30 October 2013, and in record time – less than 100 days after approval – small farmers planted Bt brinjal on 22 January 2014. This feat could not have been achieved without strong Government support and political will, particularly from the Minister of Agriculture Matia Chowdhury – the experience is exemplary for small poor countries. Bangladesh is already field testing biotech potatoes and exploring biotech cotton and rice. 
FACT # 4. Some of the ”new” biotech crops, recently approved for planting, include  food staples – potato in the US and the vegetable brinjal (eggplant) in Bangladesh. 
In 2014, the US approved two “new” biotech crops for cultivation: Innate™ potato, a food staple with lower levels of acrylamide, a potential carcinogen, and less wastage due to bruising; and a reduced lignin alfalfa event KK179 (HarvXtra™) with higher digestibility and yield (alfalfa is #1 forage crop in the world). Indonesia approved a drought tolerant sugarcane. Brazil approved Cultivance™, a HT soybean, and a home-grown virus resistant bean, ready for planting in 2016. Vietnam approved biotech maize (HT and IR) for the first time in 2014. In addition to the current biotech food crops which directly benefit consumers (white maize in South Africa, sugar beet and sweet corn in the US and Canada, and papaya and squash in the US) new biotech food crops include the queen of the vegetables (brinjal) in Bangladesh and potato in the US – potato is the fourth most important food staple globally and can contribute to food security in countries like China (6 million hectares of potato), India (2 million) and the EU (~2 million). 
FACT # 5. The top 5 countries planting biotech crops. 
The US continued to be the lead country with 73.1 million hectares (40% of global) with over 90% adoption for the principal crops of maize (93% adoption) soybean (94%) and cotton (96%). Whereas Brazil has been #1 in year-to-year hectare growth for the last five years, the US ranked #1 in 2014, with 3 million hectares, compared to 1.9 million hectares for Brazil. Notably, Brazil planted the stacked HT/IR soybean on a record 5.2 million hectares in its second year after the launch. Argentina retained third place, down marginally with 24.3 million hectares, from 24.4 million in 2013. India ranked fourth, had a record 11.6 million hectares of Bt cotton (11.0 in 2013), and 95% adoption. Canada was fifth at 11.6 million hectares also, with more canola and a high 95% adoption. In 2014, each of the top 5 countries planted more than 10 million hectares providing a broad, solid foundation for future sustained growth. 
FACT # 6. The first biotech drought tolerant maize planted in the US in 2013 increased more than 5-fold in 2014. 
Biotech DroughtGard™ tolerant maize, first planted in the US in 2013, increased 5.5-fold from 50,000 hectares in 2013 to 275,000 hectares in 2014 reflecting farmer acceptance – the same event was donated to the public-private partnership, Water Efficient Maize for Africa (WEMA) aimed at delivering  biotech drought tolerant maize to selected countries in Africa by 2017. 
FACT # 7. Status of biotech crops in Africa. 
The continent continued to make progress with South Africa, marginally lower at 2.7 million hectares mainly due to drought. Sudan increased Bt cotton hectarage by almost 50%, whilst drought precluded a potentially higher hectarage than 0.5 million hectares in Burkina Faso. An additional seven countries (Cameroon, Egypt, Ghana, Kenya, Malawi, Nigeria and Uganda) conducted field trials on pro-poor crops, the penultimate step prior to approval. Importantly, the WEMA project is scheduled to deliver the first stacked biotech drought tolerant (DT) maize with insect control (Bt) in South Africa in 2017. Lack of science-based and cost/time-effective regulatory systems is the major constraint to adoption. Responsible, rigorous but not onerous, regulation is urgently needed to suit the needs of small famers and poor developing countries. 
FACT # 8. Status of biotech crops in the EU. 
Five EU countries continued to plant 143,016 hectares down marginally by 3% from 2013. Spain led with 131,538 hectares of Bt maize, down 3% from 2013, but with a record 31.6% adoption. In summary, there were modest increases in three EU countries and slight decreases in two countries, due mainly to less planting of maize and bureaucracy. 
FACT # 9. Benefits offered by biotech crops. 
A new 2014 global meta-analysis confirmed significant multiple benefits, during the last 20 years. A global meta-analysis of 147 studies in the last 20 years, confirmed that “on average GM technology adoption has reduced chemical pesticide use by 37%, increased crop yields by 22%, and increased farmer profits by 68%.” These findings corroborate earlier and consistent results from other annual global studies. The latest provisional data for 1996 to 2013, showed that biotech crops contributed to Food Security, Sustainability and Environment/Climate Change by: increasing crop production valued at US$133 billion; providing a better environment, by saving ~500 million kg a.i. of pesticides from 1996 to 2012; in 2013 alone reducing CO2 emissions by 28 billion kg, equivalent to taking 12.4 million cars off the road for one year; conserving biodiversity by saving 132 million hectares of land from 1996-2013; and helped alleviate poverty for >16.5 million small farmers and their families totaling >65 million people, who are some of the poorest people in the world. Biotech crops are essential but are not a panacea – adherence to good farming practices such as rotations and resistance management, are a must for biotech crops as they are for conventional crops. 
FACT # 10. Future Prospects. 
Cautiously optimistic with modest annual gains expected due to the already high rates of adoption (90% to 100%) in the current principal biotech crops, leaving little room for expansion in mature markets in both developing and industrial countries. The pipeline is full of new biotech crop products which could (subject to regulatory approval for planting and import) be available during the next 5 years or so ‒ a list of over 70 potential products are listed in the full Brief. They include, a broad range of new crops and traits as well as products with multiple modes of resistance to pests/diseases and tolerance to herbicides; Golden Rice is progressing with field testing and late-blight resistant potatoes are being field tested in Bangladesh, Indonesia, and India. In the US, Simplot has already requested approval for an enhanced Innate™ potato with late-blight resistance and lowered reducing sugars; pro-poor crops, particularly in Africa, such as fortified bananas and pest resistant cowpea, look promising; public-private partnerships (PPP) have been relatively successful in developing and delivering approved products ‒ four PPP case studies, featuring a broad range of different crops and traits in all three continents of the South, are reviewed in the full Brief. 
Environmental benefits of genetically modified crops: Global and European perspectives on their ability to reduce pesticide use 
This paper is relevant to the impact areas in the following areas: 
The Green Revolution, which brought together improved varieties, increased use off ertilizer, irrigation and synthetic pesticides, is credited with helping to feed the current global population of 6 billion. While this paper recognizes the ability of pesticides, to reduce crop losses, it also discusses their potential negative effects on public health, with particular emphasis in developing countries, and the environment. The response of the agricultural industry in bringing forward new technology such as reduced application rates of targeted pesticides with lower toxicity and persistency is noted. However, with increasing world population, a slowing of the rate of crop improvement through conventional breeding and a declining area of land available for food production there is a need for new technologies to produce more food of improved nutritional value in an environmentally acceptable and sustainable manner. 
Whilst the authors’ recognize that the introduction of genetically modified (GM) crops is controversial, the benefits of these crops, including their effect on pesticide use is only now beginning to be documented. Published data are used to estimate what effect GM crops have had on pesticide use first on a global basis, and then to predict what effect they would have if widely grown in the European Union (EU). 
On a global basis GM technology has reduced pesticide use, with the size of the reduction varying between crops and the introduced trait. It is estimated that the use of GM soyabean, oil seed rape, cotton and maize varieties modified for herbicide tolerance and insect protected GM varieties of cotton reduced pesticide use by a total of22.3 million kg of formulated product in the year 2000. Estimates indicate that if 50% of the maize, oil seed rape, sugar beet, and cotton grown in the EU were GM varieties, pesticide used in the EU/annum would decrease by 14.5 million kg of formulated product (4.4 million kg active ingredient). In addition there would be a reduction of 7.5 million ha sprayed which would save 20.5 million litres of diesel and result in a reduction of approximately 73,000 t of carbon dioxide being released into the atmosphere. The paper also points to areas where GM technology may make further marked reductions in global pesticide use..

What is Bayer’s stance on genetically modified organisms (GMO)? 
We address some of the world's most pressing global challenges and continue to develop new solutions. One significant challenge facing us is our constantly growing global population, coupled with a limited amount of land for growing food and pressure on precious resources. As such, we strive to facilitate the production of high-quality food in sufficient quantities. It is our belief that plant biotechnology, also referred to as genetic engineering (GE) or genetically modified organisms (GMOs), is a key part of this sustainable strategy. 
What Are GMOs? 
So what is a GMO? GMO refers to plants that have been bred using genetic engineering, which allows plant breeders to make very specific and predictable changes to a plant. Genetic engineering involves taking desirable traits from one plant, such as resistance to drought, insects, or weeds, and applying them to another plant. It also allows plant breeders to improve an existing trait in a plant. In Canada, five genetically modified crops are widely used: canola, corn, lentils, soy and sugar beet. 
What are the benefits of GMO crops? 
Genetic engineering offers farmers a number of concrete advantages. These include using resources such as water and fuel more efficiently, fighting pests and diseases, and conserving natural habitat. 
There are environmental benefits of using plant science. Canadian canola farmers, for example, would need 91 per cent more land to grow the same amount of canola as they do now with GMO seeds – that’s the equivalent of 14 million football fields. This efficiency leads to a reduction in fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. 
In Canada, five genetically modified crops are widely used: canola, corn, lentils, soy and sugar beet. 
Are GMOs safe? 
Yes; GMOs are safe. Not one scientifically tenable study has ever indicated any risk to health posed by the use of genetic engineering in crop breeding. In 2016 representatives from 15 scientific societies met to explore the findings from more than 900 research and other publications on the purported negative effects and benefits of GMO crops. This review found no evidence of risk to human health or the environment. Read the report here. 
The safety of people and our products are our top priority. We take the research and development of our seeds seriously. We comply with all applicable laws and regulations and industry standards, and have also established our own additional internal policies. 
Genetic engineering isn’t new. Humans have been modifying plant DNA for over 10,000 years. 
Can Genetically Modified Crops
Help the Poor? Options for
Canada’s Foreign Policy
Policy Brief No. 12
April 2016

Editor’s Preface
Launched in 2009, GPS: Where Genomics,
Public Policy and Society Meet is a series hosted
by Genome Canada to facilitate a dialogue
between federal policymakers and researchers
exploring issues at the interface of genomics and
its ethical, environmental, economic, legal and
social aspects (or GE3LS).
Overarching themes for the series and specific
topics are selected on the basis of their importance and timeliness, as well as the “ripeness”
of the underlying scholarship. Accordingly, the
series focused on “Genetic information,” whereas
in year two, attention shifted to “Translational
Genomics”. The third series, “The Innovation
Continuum” broadens the discussion by
casting the process of innovation in a broader
societal context. The 2014 series focuses on
the bioeconomy. The concept of the bioeconomy is meant to capture economic activities,
and their related products and services, which
result from new discoveries in the biosciences,
including genomics.
At the core of these exchanges is the development of policy briefs that explore options to
balance the promotion of science and technology
while respecting the many other considerations
that affect the cultural, social, or economic
well-being of our society.
Co-authors of the briefs are leaders in their
field and are commissioned by Genome Canada
to synthesize and translate current academic
scholarship and policy documentation into a
range of policy options. The briefs also benefit
from valuable input provided by invited commentators and other experts who participate
in GPS events. Briefs are not intended to reflect
the authors’ personal views, nor those of
Genome Canada. Rather than advocating
a unique recommendation, briefs attempt to
establish a broader evidence base that can
inform various policymaking needs at a time
when emerging genomic technologies across
the life sciences stand to have a profound
impact on Canada.

Executive Summary
Genetically modified crops dominate agriculture in North and South America,
have been met with much reticence in Europe, and are of increasing importance
in emerging economies such as India, China and Brazil. Enthusiasm for using
genetically modified organisms (GMOs) as an agricultural development tool is rising,
spurred by significant investments by private corporations and international
donors who promote GM crops as a means for improving yields and livelihoods.
While the scientific research underpinning these new GM varieties is progressing
rapidly, the social scientific evaluation of this new paradigm of agricultural
development has struggled to keep pace. The socio-economic evaluation of
these new breeding technologies for developing countries presents a range of
possible policy options for donor nations. Some countries have invested heavily
in scientific capacity and infrastructure to facilitate GMO commercialization,
while others have been more reticent to endorse GMOs as a tool to help
achieve broader goals of agricultural development.
This brief surveys the implications of this emerging debate for Canadian
policy-makers in order to help the Canadian government to consider whether
to support the adoption of GMOs as part of agricultural development strategies.
It presents five policy options for consideration: an ‘all in’ approach robustly
supporting GM crops; a partnership approach focussing on the needs of
smallholder farmers; a ‘precaution through experience’ approach emphasizing
context-specific systems, community engagement and risk management;
a participatory farmer-led approach based on a demand-driven model of
experimentation; and a holistic approach focussing on underlying causes
of food insecurity rather than technological solutions.

About the Authors
Matthew A. Schnurr is an Associate Professor in the Department of
International Development Studies at Dalhousie University in Halifax,
Nova Scotia. His research focuses on the potential of GM crops to transform
agricultural production for smallholder, subsistence farmers. Dr. Schnurr
was the organizer of the SSHRC-funded “Can Genetically Modified Crops
Help the Poor” conference held in October 2015, which brought together
academics, policy makers and activists interested in formulating policy
recommendations on whether GM crops can contribute to the Canadian
model of international development assistance.

I. Context
Genetically modified (GM) crops are plants in which laboratory
techniques have been used to engineer the plant’s DNA to express
beneficial traits. These agricultural innovations have spread
unevenly across the globe: they form a dominant part of agriculture
in North and South America, have been met with much reticence in
Europe, and are of increasing importance in emerging economies
such as India, China and Brazil, which now account for over 30% of
all GM crops grown worldwide (James 2014). Most of the current
expansion of GM crops is rooted in developing countries: in 2012
the acreage planted in developing countries exceeded that of
developed countries for the first time, and this gap increased by
more than 10% within two years. Of the 28 countries that planted
biotech crops in 2014, 20 were developing and 8 were developed.
According to one report, nearly 90% of the 18 million farmers
growing GM crops in 2014 were smallholder farmers from
developing countries (James 2014).
Enthusiasm for using genetically modified organisms (GMOs) as
an agricultural development tool is rising, spurred by significant
investments by private corporations and international donors who
promote GM crops as a means for improving yields and livelihoods.
These investments have coalesced into a new paradigm of agricultural development in which GMO technologies are given license-free
for use in crops that matter to subsistence farmers. These public­
private partnerships (P3s) bring together the technology developer
and developing country research scientists as partners in creating
GM versions of ‘orphan’ crops that have largely been ignored by
innovation and investment. Examples currently under experimentation include water-efficient maize for drought-prone parts of
East and Southern Africa, virus-resistant cassava in East Africa,
insect-resistant cowpea in West Africa, and bio-fortified Golden
rice in South Asia. These second-generation GM crops are being

trumpeted as a technology that can combat poverty and reduce
food insecurity: both the World Bank (2007) and the United Nations’
Food and Agriculture Organization (Ruane et al. 2013) have
endorsed GM crops as a win-win strategy for agricultural development, serving the interests of both donor countries and small
landholder farmers.
While the scientific research underpinning these new GM varieties
is progressing rapidly, the social scientific evaluation of this new
paradigm of agricultural development has struggled to keep pace.
Much of the scholarship examining the socio-economic dimensions
has focused on quantifying potential benefits that GM crops offer
to poor farmers via increased yields, better nutrition, and labour
savings, which have been estimated to be as high as US$3 billion
(Qaim 2010; Park et al. 2011). Other social scientists are more
cautious, emphasizing political and economic variables that play a
significant role in determining whether GM crops can help improve
livelihoods for poor, rural farmers (Stone 2011; Fitting 2011;
Akram-Lodhi 2013).
The socio-economic evaluation of these new breeding technologies
for developing countries presents a range of possible policy
options for donor nations. Some countries (such as the United
States, Canada and Australia) have invested heavily in scientific
capacity and infrastructure to facilitate GMO commercialization,
while others (such as France and Germany) have been more
reticent to endorse GMOs as a tool to help achieve broader goals
of agricultural development. This brief surveys the implications
of this emerging debate for Canadian policy-makers.
Specifically, the question this brief will address is this: Should
the Canadian government support the adoption of GMOs as
part of agricultural development strategies?

II. Background: The International
Policy Landscape
The most useful start for examining the various policy options
available to donor countries such as Canada is the long-standing
divide between the American approach to GMOs (rooted in the
principle of substantial equivalence) and the European approach
(rooted in the precautionary principle).
The American policy approach towards GMOs has emphasized
similarities in product between conventional and GM breeding
(as opposed to differences in process, as emphasized in Europe).
The US approach is rooted in the principle of substantial equivalence, in which GMOs are viewed as comparable to the products
of conventional farming; as such, there is no need to create new
institutions or new regulations to oversee them (Lieberman and
Gray 2008). In practical terms, this means that GM crops and foods
are treated the same as conventional products, a dynamic that
has created debates both domestically (in the form of continuing
disputes over state-level GMO labeling laws) and internationally
(in terms of rejected trade shipments due to the low level presence
of unapproved GM events).
The United States supports the use of GMOs as part of the strategy to
achieve its agricultural development goals. In 2002 the U.S. Agency
for International Development (USAID) launched the Collaborative
Agricultural Biotechnology Initiative (CABIO) “to promote developing
country access to and management of new scientific tools such as
biotechnology for improving agriculture productivity, environmental
sustainability and nutrition” (U.S. Department of State and USAID
2005: 191). CABIO led to the establishment of a suite of programs
dedicated to building infrastructure, developing capacity and
sharing information around the potential for agricultural biotechnology (including GMOs) to help alleviate poverty and hunger around
the world.
One of the most visible programs to emerge from this policy was the
Agricultural Biotechnology for Sustainable Productivity Project (ABSP).
ABSP is a consortium of private and public organizations designed to
promote biotechnology in three regional centres (south Asia, southeast Asia and east Africa), with the overarching aims of increasing
access to technical expertise and encouraging the transfer of biotechnology tools (Cohen 1999). During the past twelve years, ABSP
has focused primarily on infrastructure development (i.e. construction
of laboratories, greenhouses and confined field trials) and capacity
building (funding graduate students in the areas of molecular
biology, plant breeding and biosafety management). The Program
for Biosafety Systems (PBS) is a second important project, managed
by the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFRPI), whose
mandate includes supporting policy development, creating awareness and facilitating regulatory approval. PBS aspires to create an
enabling environment to advance the safe use of biotechnology
into new markets.

Additionally, the United States has played a crucial role in establishing the African Agricultural Technology Foundation (AATF). The
AATF is a key intermediary facilitating public-private partnerships
(P3s) technology transfers to national research scientists for
humanitarian purposes. This emerging model challenges many of the
most entrenched preconceptions around GM crops. First, the AATF
negotiates with patent holders to donate proprietary technologies
license-free, so they are available to farmers at no cost. Second,
the traits being prioritized move beyond the narrowly focused
insect- and herbicide-tolerance towards addressing a range of issues
that matter to small landholder farmers, such as drought-tolerance,
disease-resistance and nutritional enhancement. Third, the crops
being prioritized are major carbohydrate staples across the continent
(sorghum, cowpea, cassava and matooke banana) that have not been
targets of genetic modification because biotech companies have traditionally emphasized varieties that have broader adoption potential.
European doubts around GMOs stem from a broader interpretation of
the precautionary principle (Principle 15 of the 1992 Rio Declaration),
in which GMOs are viewed as foundationally different from previous
techniques of selective and mutagenic breeding. This focus on the
exceptional nature of GMOs leads to an approach that is fundamentally risk-averse, in which novel biotechnological techniques must
be subjected to rigorous tests including the identification of any and
all potential harms to human health or the environment, evaluating
different types and levels of uncertainty involved, and mitigating
any potential risk that could emerge from the new biotechnology
(Myhr 2010; Ludlow et al. 2014).
This more conservative approach to risk assessment and management of GMOs among European nations has led to policies at
home and abroad that are relatively comprehensive and onerous,
including strict measures for approval, monitoring and liability.
France, long considered to espouse one of the continent’s most
reticent views towards GMOs, remains sceptical regarding their
possibilities both inside and outside its borders. While there is
no formal stance on the role of GMOs in foreign policy, current
debates within France revolve around the role GMOs play in exacerbating inequality, and the need for stronger regulations to limit
off-farm migration, soil erosion and increased food-price volatility
(Tait and Barker 2011). Such principles have become formalized
in Norway under the Norwegian Gene Technology Act, which stipulates that any new GMO introduced in the country must undergo
an impact assessment that includes consideration of sustainability
and societal utility. Within this act the assessment of non-safety
concerns is mandatory, and “can include any health and environmental consequences in the countries in which the crops are
grown—notably developing countries—as well as in the countries
in which they are consumed” (Marcoux et al. 2013: 662).

Adherence to and application of the precautionary principle has
not been uniform across Europe. The government of the United
Kingdom, for example, has produced a series of recent reports
identifying GM technology as one component in a wider approach to
food security and food production (Dibden et al. 2013). Specifically,
the concept of sustainable intensification has been put forth as a
necessity for both meeting the increasing global demand for food
and for attempting to bridge the divide between the “agri-industrial/
biotech and agro-ecological paradigms by drawing on aspects of
both” (Dibden et al. 2013: 65). Indeed, one UK Foresight report
identifies investment in transgenic technologies as essential, and
stresses the need to keep open policy options pertaining to such
technology (Tait and Barker 2011). This view is espoused by former
Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Owen
Paterson, who remains a vocal proponent of using GMOs as a pillar
of Britain’s efforts to alleviate poverty and hunger (Paterson 2015).

III. Issues: Can GMOs Help The Poor?
Proponents argue that GMOs are an important tool in the global
fight against poverty and hunger, one that donor nations such
as Canada should support both politically and financially (Smyth
et al. 2015). Harvard’s Robert Paarlberg (2009: 84) argues
passionately that donor countries have a responsibility to invest in
low-income agricultural systems, which have a reduced opportunity
of benefiting from ‘spillover’ effects of beneficial technologies
operated elsewhere. What is needed, he argues, is a concerted
push to introduce and evaluate the potential for GM crops to help
farmers in the poorest parts of the world. He suggests that Africa
is particularly well-suited for this investment in GM technology
because farmers tend to be land-secure, thus increasing their
chances of benefiting from a technological upgrade. According to
Paarlberg, the problem in Africa is not inadequate pay-off of GM
technology but rather adequate pay-in on the part of development
donors: “Africa’s agricultural science deficit will thus have to be
corrected through supportive interventions from international
donors…restoring this external support should now be an urgent
priority” (Paarlberg 2009: 195).
Jennifer Thompson is another proponent of the potential for GM
crops to help African farmers. She emphasizes that GM crops are
but one tool in the struggle for sustainable agriculture, but one that
deserves more investment from donors because of its ease of use
and the dramatic benefits GMOs can offer to poor farmers. She
believes that it would be “a major injustice if prejudices against this
technology, expressed by those with enough food, were to deny the
use of GM crops to the poor and hungry in other parts of the world”
(Thompson 2015: 158).
However, this new wave of second-generation GM ventures has
also been subjected to critique. First, there are concerns about the
power relations that frame these interventions, and questions about

the degree to which such projects truly reflect farmer needs and
priorities (Schnurr 2013). Second, critics argue that that the narrative of progress underpinning science-based risk assessments
works to depoliticize GM technology and reposition it as a moral
imperative (Dibden et al. 2013). Within this view, framing GMOs as
a technology that can ‘feed the world’ is a clever public relations
strategy that could crowd out other promising approaches such as
agro-ecology. Other critics view the new wave of GM in developing
countries as a Trojan horse that serves to establish collaborations
between private biotech companies and Southern research countries, cultivate good public relations for private sector donors, and
facilitate the advancement of more permissive GM regulations
(Lieberman and Gray 2008: 407).

IV. Background: a GMO policy dichotomy
in Canada
As in many other areas, Canada’s position within this debate lies
somewhere between the more extreme poles of the United States
and Europe (Andree 2006). When it comes to the regulation of
new GM crop varieties, Canada parallels the U.S. in the use of a
science-based risk assessment protocol. But when it comes
to adopting these innovative technologies into foreign policy,
Canada’s approach aligns more with Europe.
Canadian policy towards GMOs has remained broadly consistent
across the changing Progressive Conservative/Liberal/Conservative
governments of the past three decades. Canada’s domestic
approach has, by and large, synched with the substantial equivalence approach adopted by the United States. In 1993, the federal
government introduced the Federal Regulatory Framework for
Biotechnology, with the goal of minimizing environmental risks
while fostering competitiveness (Abergel and Barrett 2002;
MacDonald 2014). This framework provided guidelines for the
environmental assessment of unconfined release, which, by the
end of 1994, signaled the beginning of Canada’s product-based
regulatory regime. In 1998, the federal government introduced the
new Canadian Biotechnology Strategy (CBS), which established
the Canadian Biotechnology Advisory Committee (CBAC) in 1999
to advise on science and social policy issues (Marcoux and
Letourneau 2013; Skogstad 2008).
CBAC was an arm’s length expert group that undertook in-depth
assessment of emerging genomic-related issues, ranging from patenting of higher life forms to labelling of GMO products. On occasion,
CBAC reports were critical of the government’s biotechnology policy
and the regulatory regime, arguing that the system needed more
transparency and accountability. Measures introduced early in the
new millennium developed guiding principles for applying precaution
to science-based decision-making within the regulatory regime that
identified health, safety, and the environment as key areas of concern,
before CBAC was disbanded in 2007 (Skogstad 2008).

Another critical moment that shaped the trajectory of this country’s
regulatory path was the government’s response to the 2001 Royal
Society of Canada’s Expert Panel on the Future of Food Biotechnology.
This report was largely critical of the government’s regulatory
processes and capacities, recommending that both needed to be
substantially beefed up. The RSC panel also offered a sharp rebuke
to the government’s emphasis on substantial equivalence, which
the panel regarded as too poorly defined and overly superficial. The
report called for a plethora of more stringent regulations, including
more comprehensive environmental and food safety assessment,
enhanced post-release monitoring and evaluation, and increased
public transparency in all decision-making. Within one year of its
publication, the Liberal government produced a detailed action plan
to address these recommendations, though Peter Andree argues
that while the RSC panel’s original recommendations were
designed to tilt the Canadian approach more towards the precautionary principle, they had relatively little impact on real-world
policy or process (Andree 2006).
Assessments of the effectiveness of the Canadian policy approach
to GMOs vary widely. The system has many champions who laud
the approach as being largely free from the influence of industry
actors and committed to the rigorous evaluation of ‘sound science’
(Montpetit 2005; MacDonald 2014: 341). Critics argue that Canada’s
regulatory system is structured around ensuring public and investor
confidence in Canada’s business climate and in recombinant DNA
technology itself, and does a woeful job of incorporating public consultations (Abergel and Barrett 2002: 155). Others contend that the
development of Canadian policy has unfolded within a narrow network of biotechnology developers, representatives, government
officials and scientific experts, and that the Canadian approach
remains preoccupied with minimizing discrepancies with the US
for fear of creating trade barriers (Skogstad 2008).
With respect to foreign policy, Canada has been much more
reluctant to act as an advocate for investment in agricultural
technology. The recent emphasis on enhanced food security
as a thematic priority for international development assistance
has led to a broad investment in technological development and
market expansion that has included an emphasis on GM alongside
other breeding programs (DFATD 2014a). Agricultural biotechnology has also emerged as a key sector within efforts aimed at
increasing ties with emerging economies such as India, China
and Brazil (Government of Canada 2012; Government of Canada
2013; DFATD 2014b).
Canada also boasts a long history of investing in science and
technology as a means of enhancing food security and nutrition,
with long-standing programs dedicated to improved cassava
breeding in Latin America (Aerni 2006), biotechnology applications to improve livestock management in Kenya (Hall 2005),
fortifying foods with micro-nutrients in the Philippines (IDRC

2015c), strengthening seed systems in Afghanistan (IDRC 2015a),
and expanding the use of DNA barcoding around the world (IDRC
2015b). Most significantly, Canada’s recent investment in the
IDRC-led Canadian International Food Security Research Fund
has supported partnerships in the broader areas of agricultural
innovation and technology transfer (though it is important to note
that none of the current funded projects utilize GM technology).
Overall, Canada’s foreign policy towards GMOs has been considerably more hesitant than its domestic policy. GM crops have
been mainstays of the nation’s agricultural production systems for
twenty years, yet remain virtually invisible within the country’s
international development agenda. Broader commitments to technology transfer, capacity building and the potential for scientific
technology to help achieve agricultural development goals abound,
but there are virtually no specific references to the role GM crops
can play in achieving these objectives within existing Canadian
foreign policy.

V. Policy Options
1. The ‘all in’ approach
Canadian foreign policy-makers embrace GM crops as a breeding
technology that can contribute to improving global food security.
Canadian support, combined with ongoing U.S. initiatives, includes
political and financial backing for the inclusion of GM breeding
techniques as critical elements of a broader investment in science
and technology infrastructure. One concrete example for how to
go about this is offered by Smyth et al. 2013, who suggest that
the most effective means of encouraging the commercialization of
GMOs in Africa is to combat fears around potential harm to African
exports to Europe. They propose that donor nations such as Canada
establish a compensation fund with credible commitments to meet
potential export losses. By providing just-in-time compensation for
countries negatively impacted by the commercialization of GMOs,
this liability fund would help overcome one of the major hurdles to
the widespread disseminations of GMOs in Africa.
One potential avenue for accomplishing this would be for Global
Affairs Canada (GAC) to adopt a mandate similar to that of the United
States Agency for International Development, whereby support for
existing Canadian agriculture technologies and practices becomes
a key aspect of Canada’s international activities. GAC would support
the public plant breeders and private agriculture technology development companies that have commercialized technologies and crop
varieties providing significant benefits in terms of yield and sustainability. To make a contribution to improving global food security,
support for proven technologies would underpin Canadian
international development programs.

Within this view, Canada’s role would transform into a global
ambassador for agricultural innovations more generally and
GMOs specifically, working towards educating and informing
scientists and regulators on how new technologies can help to
achieve broader goals of agricultural development. Adopting such
an enthusiastic approach would likely be welcomed by Canadian
industry, which would be excited about potential opportunities to
parlay existing knowledge and products in ways that could benefit
both trade and development. Conversely, the approach would likely
be significantly criticized by the NGO community, who would be
concerned that such a narrow focus on technologies has the
potential to preclude broader conversations around the nature
of poverty and hunger.

2. The partnership approach
Canadian policy-makers embrace a model that uses partnerships
between relevant sectors, in order to create GMOs with the traits and
varieties that matter to smallholder farmers. Within this approach,
Canada’s role would be that of a facilitator, focused on brokering
partnerships among multi-sectoral partners, securing access to
proprietary technology for use in not-for-profit endeavors, and
helping to guide negotiations around some of the more polarizing
issues. Canada would advocate for the central role played by the
private sector within such initiatives, which is often best positioned
to provide the expertise and technology needed to create GM
varieties that are well-suited to the needs of smallholder farmers.
Canadian interventions would focus on emphasizing potential
gains associated with bringing the private sector into partnerships
(i.e. facilitating access to technology, enhanced capacity building,
and increased expertise related to downstream activities such as
commercialization and marketing for public sector partners, as
well as benefits to the private sector in the form of building future
markets and enhancing corporate image).
Some promising examples exist for how the private sector can be
successfully integrated into initiatives designed to target the needs
of smallholder farmers. Agricultural ‘pull mechanisms’, for example,
provide results-based payments to incentivize innovation in areas
with little existing profit potential. These financial incentives are
designed to overcome market failures and encourage the creation
of new innovations with high development impacts by strengthening the demand for such socially desirable projects. Using the
G20’s newly established AgResults program as a model, Canada
could mobilize such mechanisms as a means of encouraging the
development of new GM technologies that are not currently available through traditional market mechanisms (AgResults 2015).
Existing P3s could serve as viable templates for future initiatives.
P3s are designed to accomplish synergistic goals that none of the
individual partners could achieve on their own, offering promising

vehicles for joint technological innovation and commercialization
of new GM technologies. A number of P3s are already underway
experimenting with GM versions of African carbohydrate staple
crops addressing traits (such as disease or pest resistance) that
resonate with poor farmers. For example, an existing P3 has
produced a banana that is genetically modified to resist Banana
Bacterial Wilt, one of the most pernicious diseases affecting growers in Uganda. This partnership brings together Ugandan research
scientists, the United States Agency for International Development,
the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the African Agricultural
Technology Foundation, which facilitated access to proprietary
technology in order to develop an end product that is license-free.
In a second example, GM versions of cassava are being bred to
resist cassava mosaic disease and brown streak disease, again
through a grouping of development donors, African scientists and
private sector partners. P3s offer a means of overcoming some of
the most entrenched obstacles blocking more sustained application
of biotechnology to the needs of poor farmers, including limited
profit potential and under-developed or under-enforced regulatory
regimes that have limited effectiveness in protection intellectual
property rights.
Embracing this policy approach could also involve moving beyond
existing partnership models to innovate novel strategies. The
partnerships noted above have been criticized for prioritizing the
needs of donors over those of producers, and for failing to include
producers as meaningful partners in every stage of the partnership
process. Canada has the opportunity to play a crucial role in transforming these P3s into P4s by recognizing that the ‘producer’ (that
is, the proposed beneficiary) should play a central role in shaping
and delivering new agricultural technologies. Canada is already a
world leader in agriculture-based P4s, with a number of domestic
initiatives—such as the Saskatchewan Pulse Growers and the
Western Grain Research Foundation—providing important models
of how such producer-led projects can stimulate innovation (Boland
2014). The Canadian government could play the role of broker or
enabler, ensuring that partnerships for agricultural development are
created and implemented based on shared values and inclusivity,
and that producer priorities are at the centre of all partnership
activities (Thrope and Maestre 2015).

3. The ‘precaution through experience’ approach
Canadian policy-makers embrace a middle-of-the-road strategy
that seeks to balance European adherence to the precautionary
principle with American notions of substantial equivalence by
incorporating greater public participation in an ‘evidence-informed’
framework. Such an approach would move the unit of analysis
away from both the process (the focus of European regulations)
and the product (the focus of American regulations) towards an
emphasis on context-specific systems, including a robust system

Can Genetically Modified Crops Help the Poor? Options for Canada’s Foreign Policy Policy Brief No. 12

6

of risk management that incorporates “both scientific and
socio-economic perspectives of risk in deepened deliberative
settings.” (Clark 2013: 480). According to Clark “[i]dentifying the
sources of complexity within governance frameworks can help
to better understand what influences decision-making within
multi-level risk governance” (p.486). By bringing both sciencebased and non-scientist perspectives of risk under the same
umbrella, Canadian policy-makers would widen the scope of
issues considered by the regulatory process.
At the core of the ‘precaution through experience’ approach is a
commitment to robust and deliberatively democratic practices that
incorporate the full range of benefits and risks by emphasizing
the principles of transparency, participation and accountability.
Zahabi-Bekdash and Lavery (2010) refer to the role of community
engagement early on as a means of satisfying some of the aims of
precaution without undermining the development of new technologies.
Hibbert and Clark (2014) agree, stressing the need for “negotiated
rulemaking” that allows stakeholders to participate in the regulation
drafting phases as one of the best strategies for making the debate
over new GM technologies more inclusive and democratic. They
offer the Norwegian Gene Technology Act as a viable model that
incorporates a wide range of socioeconomic and sustainability criteria within its risk assessment, including impacts on biodiversity,
global justice, inter-generational justice, greenhouse gas emissions
and potential benefits to local communities.
There are several potential benefits to such an approach. Including
a wider range of consultations in the decision-making process
could access unique knowledge to help improve the product itself,
and/or the social pathways leading to successful experimentation
and implementation (Zahabi-Bekdash and Lavery 2010). Others
see the primary benefit stemming from the democratic legitimacy
gained by engaging in such a consultative process, creating a
space where critics and supporters of controversial technologies
can coexist (Hibbert and Clark 2014).
This model incorporates social learning by drawing on lessons
from previous experiences with GM crops. Such a model would,
for instance, see Canadian policy encouraging recipient nations
to fast-track some GM varieties based on previous experience
elsewhere with similar technologies in conjunction with the development of participatory governance systems. This is similar to the
current model initiated by the Common Market for Eastern and
Southern Africa (COMESA), which adopted a centralized regional
framework and a harmonized risk assessment mechanism. These
were designed to allow technologies that are vetted, tested and
approved in one member country to be approved in another country
without unnecessary delay. However, the outcome of regulatory
expediency is open to critique; first, on the grounds that the rhetoric
of inclusivity and participation outweigh the reality, and second,

that such efforts towards regulatory harmonization are strategies
to circumvent the complications that can plague the release of
controversial technologies at the national scale (Schnurr 2013).

4. The participatory, farmer-led approach
At the core of this approach is a commitment to a demand-driven
model of experimentation that incorporates producers as equals at
every project stage. Existing examples of such farmer-led breeding
programs could serve as models for future GM ventures. Since
2009 the Canadian International Development Agency (now
Global Affairs Canada) has provided funding to Unitarian Service
Committee (USC) Canada, which works with a Honduran NGO
supporting farmer-led participatory research on improving local
varieties of maize and beans. FIPAH (Foundation for Participatory
Research with Honduran Farmers) is made up of agronomists/
farmer leaders who reside in the communities and provide technical
assistance to communities, training local farmers to execute,
evaluate and analyze formal agricultural experiments. FIPAH initiates a Community-Based Agricultural Research Team (CIAL) in a
community, and subsequently brainstorms with the community
which crops deserve priority focus. The CIAL is then responsible for
deciding what problems to tackle, what kind of research to undertake, and how to use this information to help other communities.
Farmers are trained to evaluate for their specific research objective
on their own farm, and when the experiments are complete, the
CIAL formalizes the research through a report and presentation.
Results are presented to their own and nearby communities in a
way that emphasizes the local issues. For example, a group of
Santa Cruz farmers successfully developed a variety of shorter
stalked corn with large cobs that would withstand more frequent
hurricanes. Culinary traditions are often taken into account when
breeding for traits in these communities (USC Canada, 2009).
The Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC) and
the Rockefeller Foundation fund the Southern African Drought and
Low Soil Fertility Project (SADLF), run by the International Maize
and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT). This program shares
geographic information systems (GIS) data with maize researchers
so varieties can be bred to support local conditions. SADLF runs
across countries by testing at several different sites, allowing
researchers to investigate how different maize cultivars perform
under the stress conditions facing smallholder farmers. Maize is
evaluated pre-release for desirable traits, drought and nitrogen
stress, responsiveness to favourable conditions, resistance to
disease, tolerance of acidic soils and resistance to storage pests.
SADLF uses mother/baby trials to open a forum for smallholder
farmer communication: ‘mother’ trials are researcher-managed
experiments, and six to twelve ‘baby’ trials are farmer-managed
in the same community, all within walking or bicycling distance.

Can Genetically Modified Crops Help the Poor? Options for Canada’s Foreign Policy Policy Brief No. 12

7

A local counterpart, normally within the centre of a farming community,
manages the mother trials. Baby trials contain a subset of the
cultivars included in the mother trial and are planted and managed
exclusively by the farmer. The farmer will use the information from
the mother/baby trials to buy seeds in following years. Information
on farmers’ opinions of the trials and performance thereby flows
back to researchers and seed companies, increasing the prospect
of seed companies providing farmers with appropriate seeds
(CIMMYT, 2003).

In this scenario, the foundational question of GM’s potential to
help poor farmers is replaced with a more holistic, critical view
of agricultural development that begins with the needs of farmers
themselves. A narrow focus on technologies has the potential to
preclude broader conversations around the nature of poverty and
hunger, and the potential political dimensions of such interventions.
An alternative starting point would be a wider focus that does not
preclude any technological or political possibilities for effecting
meaningful change for the world’s most vulnerable farmers.

There are significant drawbacks to this approach. First, these
models are slow, expensive and time-consuming. Wettasinha et al.
(2014) emphasizes that truly participatory models require donors
to allocate longer than typical time frames in order to ensure successful partnerships that are able to engage in significant reflection.
To institutionalize farmer-led approaches, donors would need to be
persuaded to become more flexible in allowing for “differentiated
funding arrangements” that would permit a more decentralized
model of technological development (Wettasinha et al., 2014).
Second, participatory approaches have been criticized for not being
effective at targeting the very poor. It is often easier to target less
remote and relatively more privileged groups than extremely poor,
remote or excluded minority groups. Even when these communities
are effectively targeted, elite actors frequently dominate projects.
The power differentials at play are extremely important but can be
minimized when farm ‘leaders’ are residents of the community
and farmers themselves (Classen et al. 2008).

Within this view, the foundational question could be broadened to
‘Under what conditions should the Canadian government support
the adoption of certain GMOs as part of its agricultural development
strategies?’ or even ‘What approaches to agricultural development
should Canada support?’ Shifting the starting point for this conversation would facilitate a broader conversation about how Canada
could best support the needs of poor farmers, and might lead to
more political interventions such as renegotiating terms of trade
and removing agricultural subsidies, as opposed to the development of new technologies such as GM.

5. The holistic approach
Instead of focusing efforts on technological solutions to systemic
problems of poverty and hunger, Canadian policy shifts towards
a more holistic approach that seeks to address the underlying
causes of food insecurity in terms of access, control and justice.
A new policy agenda emerges that prioritizes discussion of structural factors including global trade deficits, agricultural subsidies,
and smaller-scale technology transfer that are demand- rather
than supply-driven.

VI. Practical considerations
Canadian policy makers face a number of challenges on this
controversial file. First, they will need to establish a model that
successfully integrates the perspectives of natural scientists (who
tend to be more bullish on the prospects for GM crops to improve
livelihoods for poor farmers) and social scientists (who tend to be
more cautious about potential benefits). Successful experimental
programs and development interventions will benefit from both
perspectives, even though the discussion about which variables
and parameters will form the basis of an agreement may be challenging and at times frustrating.
The second practical consideration relates to the technology itself.
Advances in new breeding techniques are expanding at a breakneck pace, with new technologies such as gene editing, CRISPR
and synthetic biology offering possibilities that were unimaginable
even five years earlier. These will radically challenge the slow
moving regulatory and policy debate, which is still discussing
issues (such as gene flow and transgenic contamination) that
new technologies have moved beyond.

Farmers using improved seeds and biotech crop varieties continue to see significant economic and on-farm environmental benefits, according to the seventh annual report on crop biotechnology impacts prepared by UK-based PG Economics. 
According to Graham Brookes, director of PG Economics and co-author of the report, a majority (55 percent) of the 2010 farm income gains went to farmers in developing countries.  Ninety percent of these are resource poor on small farms. 
The report also showed substantial environmental benefits. Crop biotechnology had contributed to greatly reducing the release of greenhouse gas emissions from agricultural practices. This results from less fuel use and additional soil carbon storage from reduced tillage biotech crops. In 2010, the reduction in carbon dioxide from the atmosphere was equivalent to taking 8.6 million cars off the road for one year. 
BACKGROUND 
The PG Economics annual crop biotechnology global impacts report quantifies the impact of agricultural biotechnology on the environment and on farmer incomes since biotech’s commercialization in 1996. Its goal is to give insights into the motivations behind why so many farmers around the globe have adopted crop biotechnology and continue to use it in their production systems since the technology first joined the widespread commercial market in the mid 1990s. 
The report draws, and is largely based on, the considerable body of peer reviewed literature available that has examined the economic and other reasons behind farm level crop biotechnology adoption, together with the environmental impacts associated with the changes. 
KEY FINDINGS OF THE REPORT 
Biotech crops have contributed to significantly reducing the amount of greenhouse gas emissions from agricultural practices. This results from less fuel use and additional soil carbon storage from reduced tillage with biotech crops. 
In 2010, this was equivalent to removing 19.4 billion kg of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere or equal to removing 8.6 million carsfrom the road for one year. 
Crop biotechnology has reduced pesticide spraying (1996-2010) by 438 million kg (-8.6%). As a result, the environmental impact associated with herbicide and insecticide use on the area planted to biotech crops decreased by 17.9 percent. 
Farmers who use improved seeds and grow biotech crops have seen substantial net economic benefits at the farm level amounting to $14 billion in 2010 and $78.4. billion for the 15 year (1996-2010)period. 
Of the total farm income benefit, 60 percent ($46.8 billion) has been due to yield gains, with the balance arising from reductions in the cost of production. 
A majority (55 percent) of the 2010 farmer income gains went to farmers in developing countries, 90 percent of which are resource poor and small farms. 
Since 1996, biotech traits have added 97.5 million tonnes and 159.4 million tonnes respectively to global production of soybeans and corn. The technology has also contributed an extra 12.5 million tonnes of cotton lint and 6.1 million tonnes of canola. 
TALKING POINTS 
Over the 15-year period covered in this report, crop biotechnology has consistently provided important economic and production gains, improved incomes and reduced risk for farmers around the world that have grown GE crops. 
The environment in user countries is benefiting from farmers using more benign herbicides or replacing insecticide use with insect resistant GE crops. 
The reduction in pesticide spraying and the switch to no till cropping systems is also resulting in reduced greenhouse gas emissions. 
The majority of these benefits are found in developing countries. 
The advantages of advanced seed technology for farmers in developing countries come at a time when good availability is becoming more of an issue around the world. The population continues to grow, but for many farmers, their ability to produce food remains stuck in the past. In order to double food production by 2050 to meet demand, new seed technologies must be utilized. 
Because biotech-enhanced plants have a built-in resistance to pests, growers are using fewer chemical sprays, which is better for the environment. Also, biotech crops thrive without the need for tilling the soil. This uses less fuel on the farm and allows carbon to remain in the soil, enhancing both air and soil quality.

Farmers around the world who use seeds improved with biotechnology are benefitting economically while improving the environmental sustainability of their farming operations according to a newly released global impacts study.The economic benefits for farmers who use genetically modified (GM) seeds amounted to an average of more than $117/hectare in 2012, according to the report <i>&ldquo;GM Crops:&nbsp; Global Socio-Economic and Environmental Impacts 1996-2012&rdquo; </i>released today by PG Economics.
WASHINGTON, D.C. (May 6, 2014) – Farmers around the world who use seeds improved with biotechnology are benefitting economically while improving the environmental sustainability of their farming operations according to a newly released global impacts study. 
The economic benefits for farmers who use genetically modified (GM) seeds amounted to an average of more than $117/hectare in 2012, according to the report “GM Crops:  Global Socio-Economic and Environmental Impacts 1996-2012” released today by PG Economics. 
“Half of the farm income gains and the majority of the environmental gains associated with changes in pesticide use and reductions in greenhouse gas emissions occurred in developing countries,” said Graham Brookes, co-author of the report. 
"Dr. Cathleen Enright, executive vice president for food and agriculture for the Biotechnology Industry Organization (BIO), points out that the report’s findings regarding biotechnology’s contributions to the environment are equally significant. 
“The increased use of insect-resistant crops has reduced the need for chemical insecticides and the adoption of herbicide-tolerant crops have enabled farmers to switch to more benign herbicides to help control weeds,” says Enright.  “In addition, the switch to no-till cropping systems by farmers growing herbicide-tolerant crops has reduced on-farm fuel use, enhanced soil quality and cut greenhouse gas emissions.” 
"The PG Economics annual global impacts report quantifies the impact of agricultural biotechnology on the environment and on farmer incomes since biotech’s commercialization in 1996. Among the key findings: 
• Biotech crops have contributed to significantly reducing the amount of greenhouse gas emissions from agricultural practices. This results from less fuel use and additional soil carbon storage from reduced tillage with biotech crops 
• In 2012, this was equivalent to removing 27 billion kg of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere or equal to removing 11.9 million cars from the road for one year. 
• Crop biotechnology has reduced pesticide spraying(1996-2012) by 503 million kg (-8.8%). 
• "As a result, the environmental impact associated with herbicide and insecticide use on the area planted to biotech crops decreased by 18.7 percent. 
• The insect resistant (IR) technology used in GM cotton and GM corn has consistently delivered yield gains from reduced pest damage. The average yield gains over the 1996-2012 period across all users of this technology has been +10.4 percent for insect resistant corn and +16.1 percent for insect resistant cotton. 
• "Farmers who use improved seeds and grow biotech crops have seen substantial net economic benefits at the farm level amounting to $18.8 billion in 2012 and $116.6 billion for the 17 year (1996-2012)period. 
• The highest yield gains were obtained by farmers in developing countries, many of which are resource-poor and farm small plots of land; 
• The total farm income gain of $116.6 billion was divided equally between farmers in developing and developed countries. 
• Between 1996 and 2012, crop biotechnology was responsible for an additional 122 million tonnes of soybeans and 231 million tonnes of corn. The technology has also contributed an extra 18.2 million tonnes of cotton lint and 6.6 million tonnes of canola.

Press release: 6 May 2014: Dorchester, UK: Crop biotechnology continues to provide major environmental benefits and allow farmers to grow more, using fewer resources. A majority of these benefits are in developing countries. 
‘In the 17th year of widespread adoption, crops developed through genetic modification delivered more environmentally friendly farming practices while providing clear improvements to farmer productivity and income’ said Graham Brookes, director of PG Economics, co-author of the report. ‘Half of the farm income gains and the majority of the environmental gains associated with changes in pesticide use and reductions in greenhouse gas emissions occurred in developing countries’ 
A few highlights from this comprehensive review are: 
Crop biotechnology has contributed to significantly reducing the release of greenhouse gas emissions from agricultural practices. This results from less fuel use and additional soil carbon storage from reduced tillage with GM crops. In 2012, this was equivalent to removing 27 billion kg of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere or equal to removing 11.9 million cars from the road for one year; 
Crop biotechnology has reduced pesticide spraying (1996-2012) by 503 million kg (-8.8%). This is equal to the total amount of pesticide active ingredient applied to arable crops in the EU 27 for nearly two crop years. As a result, this has decreased the environmental impact associated with herbicide and insecticide use on the area planted to biotech crops by 18.7% (2); 
The insect resistant (IR) technology used in cotton and corn has consistently delivered yield gains from reduced pest damage. The average yield gains over the 1996-2012 period across all users of this technology has been +10.4% for insect resistant corn and +16.1% for insect resistant cotton; 
The herbicide tolerant (HT) technology used in soybeans and canola has also contributed to increased production in some countries; by helping farmers in Argentina grow a crop of soybeans after wheat in the same growing season (3), through higher yields and improved weed control; 
Between 1996 and 2012, crop biotechnology was responsible for an additional 122 million tonnes of soybeans and 231 million tonnes of corn. The technology has also contributed an extra 18.2 million tonnes of cotton lint and 6.6 million tonnes of canola; 
GM crops are allowing farmers to grow more without using additional land. If crop biotechnology had not been available to the (17.3 million) farmers using the technology in 2012, maintaining global production levels at the 2012 levels would have required additional plantings of 4.9 million ha of soybeans, 6.9 million ha of corn, 3.1 million ha of cotton and 0.2 million ha of canola. This total area requirement is equivalent to 9% of the arable land in the US, or 24% of the arable land in Brazil or 27% of the cereal area in the EU (28); 
Crop biotechnology helps farmers earn reasonable incomes for their work. The net economic benefit at the farm level in 2012 was $18.8 billion, equal to an average increase in income of $117/hectare. For the 17 year period (1996-2012), the global farm income gain has been $116.6 billion; 
The highest yield gains were obtained by farmers in developing countries, many of which are resource-poor and farm small plots of land; 
The total farm income gain of $116.6 billion was divided equally between farmers in developing and developed countries; 
Crop biotechnology continues to be a good investment for farmers around the world. The cost farmers paid for accessing crop biotechnology in 2012 ( $5.6 billion (4)(5) payable to the seed supply chain) was equal to 23% of the total gains (a total of $24.4 billion inclusive of the $18.8 billion income gains). Globally, farmers received an average of $3.33 for each dollar invested in GM crop seeds; 
Farmers in developing countries received $3.74 for each dollar invested in GM crop seeds in 2012 (the cost being equal to 21% of total technology gains), while farmers in developed countries received $3.04 for each dollar invested in GM crop seed (the cost being equal to 25% of the total technology gains). The higher share of total technology gains realised by farmers in developing countries relative to farmers in developed countries mainly reflects weaker provision and enforcement of intellectual property rights coupled with higher average levels of benefits in developing countries.

To alleviate some of the worst dangers from the looming food crisis, we must tap into the rich potential of genetic modification 
Sat 13 Oct 2012 20.02 BST First published on Sat 13 Oct 2012 20.02 BST 
Given the crises facing the planet, with the population set to reach the 9 billion mark by 2050 and increasing strains being placed on water, energy and food supplies, it would be wrong to hope there could be a single solution to the storms that lie ahead. As the government's chief scientific adviser, Sir John Beddington, once put it in an Observer interview: "There will be no silver bullet." 
However, the population biologist added a crucial caveat. It would also be foolish not to make the maximum use of the new technologies that we are developing in order to alleviate some of the worst dangers we will face in the decades that lie ahead. 
And among those scientific wonders, the use of genetically modified crops has a particularly rich potential, Beddington added. "Just look at the problems that the world faces: water shortages and salination of existing water supplies, for example. GM crops should be able to deal with that." 
It is a good point. Consider the simple issue of food that is lost before it can be harvested because it has been eaten by pests that humans have never learned to control. That loss comes to around 30%, agriculture experts calculate, a rate that cannot be allowed to continue. And GM crops are perfectly placed to solve that sort of problem. 
The work of scientists at the Rothamsted research station in England provides a good example of the sort of benefits that can be achieved through genetic modification. They have engineered a strain of wheat so that it emits a chemical called E-beta-farnesene which is also emitted by aphids when they are threatened. In effect, it tells other aphids to fly away. For good measure, E-beta-farnesene also attracts aphid predators such as ladybirds and wasps. In short, it delivers a double whammy – and one with rich potential. Aphids cause an estimated £100m of damage to crops every year in the UK alone. 
At present, the effectiveness of Rothamsted's anti-aphid GM wheat has only been demonstrated in the laboratory. Earlier this year field trials were prepared but were threatened by anti-GM campaigners. However, their protest fizzled out, a development that suggests the green movement is growing up over its opposition to genetically modified crops. 
In the end, however, science can only delay the inevitable, as Lester Brown of the Earth Policy Institute in Washington has made clear. We need to act now to start to cope with crises over water supply, world population numbers and rising carbon emissions in the hope that advances in agriculture and genetics can give us time for such measures to be introduced and take effect. 
Or, as Beddington has made clear, there are almost a billion people today who are suffering from serious food shortages and who face starvation. "It is unimaginable that in the next 10 to 20 years there will not be a worsening of that problem unless we take action now, and we have to include the widest possible range of solutions." 
GM food generally safe for humans and the environment, report says 
Regulators should focus on end product of food, rather than crops that went into it, says US study 
Associated Press in Washington 
Wed 18 May 2016 00.30 BST Last modified on Tue 9 Oct 2018 17.55 BST 
Genetically manipulated food remains generally safe for humans and the environment, a high-powered science advisory board declared in a report on Tuesday. The National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine concluded that changing the genetics of what we eat does not produce the “Frankenfood” monster some opponents claim – but is not feeding the world with substantially increased yields, as proponents promised. 
With the line between engineered and natural foods blurring because of newer techniques such as gene editing, the 408-page report said, regulators need to make their safety focus more on the end product of the food that is made rather than the nuts and bolts of its making. 
The report avoided to an extent the hot political issue of whether genetically modified food should be labelled. The study’s authors said labels aren’t needed for food safety reasons, but potentially could be justified on transparency, social and cultural grounds, somewhat similarly to stickers such as made in America. That stance was praised by some environmental and consumer groups, but criticised by some scientists as unnecessary because the food poses no unique risks. 
There is no evidence of environmental problems caused by genetically modified crops, but pesticide resistance is a problem, the report said. Farms that use genetically modified crops in general are helped, but it may be a different story for smaller farmers and in poorer areas of the world, it said. 
Most of the modified plants are soybean, cotton, corn and canola; in most cases, genetic tinkering has made them resistant to certain herbicides and insects. When farms switched from conventional crops to the engineered varieties, there was no substantial change in yields. While experimental results suggest that there should be an increase in production, the US Department of Agriculture data doesn’t show it, the report said. 
The report first said it is important not to make sweeping statements on genetically engineered foods, which it called GE. Still, “the committee concluded that no differences have been found that implicate a higher risk to human health safety from these GE foods than from their non-GE counterparts”. 
The National Academy, established by President Abraham Lincoln to provide scientific advice, has issued reports before saying it could find no safety problem with eating genetically modified food. But the academy committee chairman Fred Gould, of North Carolina State University, said this report is different because his study team started by listening to critics of such foods, examined anew more than 1,000 studies, and created a website that allows consumers to look at evidence and decide for themselves. 
“To some extent we know more about some genetically engineered food than we do about other food,” committee member Dominique Brossard of the University of Wisconsin said. “There are limits to what can be known about any food. That’s something we’re not used to hearing as consumers.” 
Many scientists who work on the issue but weren’t part of the study team lauded the report as sensible but not surprising. Mark Sorrells at Cornell called it “very well balanced, accurate, and reiterates much of what has already been published many times”. 
“Science is science, facts are facts,” emailed Bruce Chassy, an emeritus professor of biochemistry and food science at the University of Illinois. “There’s just no sound basis for their opposition, just as there was never any scientific basis to believe GM plants should be viewed any differently from any other,” 
One dissenter was Charles Benbrook, formerly of Washington State University but now a private consultant. He said he felt the risks of genetically engineered food were more serious than more mainstream scientists did, and that the human health assessments were not far-reaching enough. 
Some groups critical of genetically engineering foods criticised the report before it came out. Food & Water Watch castigated the National Academy for taking funding from biotechnology firms and using “pro-GMO scientists” to write its reports. The report was funded by the Burroughs Wellcome Fund, the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, the New Venture Fund, and the US Department of Agriculture, along with the academy itself. It was peer-reviewed by outside experts, and committee members were vetted for financial conflicts of interest, said academy spokesman William Kearney. 
Unlike many scientists, Marion Nestle of New York University, who was a reviewer but not an author of the report, said “the report reveals how little is known about the effects of GE foods”. She said if the people behind the report wanted to end the polarisation over these foods, “This won’t do the trick.” 
Many of us have heard the term “GMOs,” but how many of us know what they are as well as their benefits to the food supply and the environment? GMO (genetically modified organism) technology uses specific scientific innovation to genetically alter plants and promote desired characteristics. For example, these characteristics can help fruits and vegetables grow better under environmental stresses like drought, ward off crop diseases and pests and even forgo browning in fruits once they are sliced. 
This technology also decreases food waste, gives multiple populations reliable and nutritious food options and helps farmers use less pesticides and grow crops even more efficiently. In fact, this technology has been used for over 20 years and has been scientifically been proven to be a safe and effective way to support agriculture. 
While these scientific advances are in their 20s, the idea of cultivating crops with more desirable characteristics is thousands of years old. Farmers have been breeding plants together for millennia in order to get them to prime edible states. You should have seen kale, watermelons, carrots or bananas 10,000 years ago! They weren’t the big, beautiful, fleshy, juicy fruits and vegetables we have today. 
Here are some helping hand highlights, showcasing how GMOs are improving our food system: 
Helping Farmersand Saving Natural Resources 
GMO crops have significantly increased crop yields and simultaneously decreased pesticide use. By doing these two things combined, we are producing more food with less inputs. Decreased use of pesticides, means less pesticide production demand and also less energy use on the farmers’ end, too. 
Genetic characteristics in fruits and vegetables, such as insect- and disease-resistance, can also help farmers use less pesticides. But, in instances where pesticides won’t eliminate the presence of a pest, a genetic modification can make a crop resistant to the disease caused by pests. Drought-resistance is another trait that can be achieved through genetic modification to help farmers stabilize their crop production. In times of long periods of no rain, this characteristic can save thousands of acres of food. Talk about avoiding food waste! 
Helping to Feed Populations andProvide Nutrition 
In the United States there are 11 commercially available genetically modified crops in the United States: soybeans, corn (field and sweet), canola, cotton, alfalfa, sugar beets, summer squash, papaya, apples and potatoes. A 2016 Purdue University Study found that without GMO crops, corn yields would decline by 11 percent, soybeans would decline by 5 percent and cotton would decline by 19 percent. Thus, these reductions would mean we would either have less available corn, soybean and cotton, or we’d need more land to grow them—102,000 hectares in the United States and 1.1 million hectares globally, to be exact. 
Ever heard of “golden rice?” This is a GMO rice crop that has been developed to have and enhanced amount of beta-carotene (pro-vitamin A), a necessary and often not easily available micronutrient in different parts of the world, like the Philippines. Extreme vitamin A deficiency can lead to blindness and other health complications. 
Another example of GMO innovation contributing to enhanced nutrition are the GMO Cavendish bananas. In parts of Africa, Asia and Australia bananas are a major source of nutrition, but due to the Fusarium wilt disease (or Panama disease), bananas in these parts of the world were beginning to get wiped out. Genetic modification was used to make the bananas resistant to this disease, making this nutritious crop readily available again. 
Innovations in Food Science Help Us All 
I know that I am glad GMO technology was created to make food more accessible, affordable and nutritious. It’s great to see GMOs being used to combat pests and diseases and to promote drought resistance in plants. And, let’s not forget how GMOs increase vitamin availability, decrease pesticide use and reduce food waste. So let’s make sure to give GMOs the credit they deserve! 
Be sure to stay tuned for more articles on food technology that is helping to support our food system in innovative ways. The future of food is bright and we think it is worth exploring.

GMOs are the most commonly recognized product of biotechnology, though not necessarily the most common one. GMOs are genetically modified organisms. For example, when researchers use genetic engineering to turn off an existing gene or add a gene from another source to create a new, desirable characteristic, the resulting plants or microbes are considered GMOs. 
While it’s true that virtually everything we eat today has been genetically modified over thousands of years by selective breeding, cross-pollination and hybridization, GMOs are the product of a much more precise use of biotechnology. There are currently only eight crops grown from GMO seeds available to consumers in the U.S., and a handful more available worldwide. Those eight crops are papaya, alfalfa, sugar beets, summer squash, soybeans, cotton, corn (field and sweet), and canola. The last four – soybean, cotton, corn and canola – are the most commonly grown GMO crops, planted in 28 countries by 18 million farmers worldwide. 
Most GMOs are created to help solve problems farmers face, like fighting off insects that plague crops or protecting crops from herbicides used to control weeds, but some GMO crops – like the Hawaiian Rainbow Papaya – were created to help resist disease. A new biotech soybean from DuPont Pioneer, Plenish®, has a different nutritional profile, with 0g trans fat. Future crops grown from GMO seeds have the potential to help reduce food waste by introducing traits that reduce or eliminate browning (including the Arctic® Apple or Innate Potato), or that increase the nutritional content of crops and provide essential nutrients to our world’s most vulnerable populations (including high beta-carotene rice and bananas), or that reduce or eliminate food allergies (like peanut allergies and gluten sensitivity). 
While the benefits of GMO crops are readily apparent to the farmers who grow them, consumers still have many questions about both the benefits and safety record of biotech crops. In an effort to better address consumer questions about GMOs, we’re involved with GMO Answers, an initiative committed to responding to questions about how food is grown. To date, volunteers from across the biotech community have answered more than 600 consumer questions about GMOs. Read the top questions consumers have asked, or ask your own! 
Farmers and ranchers have many choices when it comes to growing crops as well as feed for animals. Growing conventional crops, Genetically modified (GM) crops, organic crops or a combination is the choice of a farmer. Many farmers plant GM seeds for specific reasons such as protecting their crops from adverse weather or enhancing yields. However, all methods of production contribute to meeting consumer demands for food products as well as producing healthy choices for everyone and protecting the environment.Farmers and ranchers have many choices when it comes to growing crops as well as feed for animals.

Many farmers plant GM seeds for specific reasons such as protecting their crops from adverse weather or enhancing yields. However, all methods of production contribute to meeting consumer demands for food products as well as producing healthy choices for everyone and protecting the environment.Farmers use GM seeds for a number of reasons, including to reduce crop damage from weeds, diseases and insects as well as from adverse weather conditions such as drought or flooding. GM seeds often allow farmers to be more precise about their use of inputs like nutrients, pesticides and water needed to grow crops. 
Safety and FDA Review“FDA has no basis for concluding that bioengineered foods differ from other foods in any meaningful or uniform way, or that, as a class, foods developed by the new techniques present any different or greater safety concern than foods developed by traditional plant breeding.” 
Since 1995, food from GM seeds has been commercially available and has been proven safe for human and animal consumption. No other crops have been more studied or subject to greater scientific review. GM seeds undergo testing for safety, health and nutritional value – and regulation is overseen by The Food and Drug Administration (FDA), The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 
According to the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine, there is no substantiated evidence of a difference in risks to human health between genetically engineered crops and conventionally bred crops. Research shows that the current commercial crops from GM seeds have the same nutritional properties as non-GM seed crops and are not harmful for humans and animals to consume. In the years that farmers have grown crops from GM seeds, there has not been a single instance of harm to human health. 
For roughly 10,000 years, farmers have been genetically altering plants and seeds through selective breeding to improve characteristics such as yield, taste and nutrition. Today’s GM seeds are part of this evolution – their development is sped up and more precise by inserting the genes from one plant into another in a laboratory setting. 
Using Fewer Resources to Feed More People As the world’s population grows and agricultural production land resources stay the same or diminish, GM seeds can be a critical tool in feeding the world without depleting resources or harming the environment. GM seeds can contribute to a reduction in the amount of land, water and chemicals needed to produce more food. This can contribute greatly to conservation and environmental stewardship, in particular preserving our land and keeping soil healthy. Additionally, as seed companies and researchers continue to make new strides in developing crops with the use of genetic engineering, there are increased opportunities to enhance the nutritional profile of foods that are important in developing countries that need nutrient-rich food. 
In fact, in June 2016, more than 100 Nobel laureates signed a letter urging Greenpeace to end its opposition to GMOs, and halt its campaign to prevent potentially life saving options for the world’s poor, including Golden Rice. Their campaign states “We urge Greenpeace and its supporters to re-examine the experience of farmers and consumers worldwide with crops and foods improved through biotechnology, recognize the findings of authoritative scientific bodies and regulatory agencies, and abandon their campaign against ‘GMOs’ in general and Golden Rice in particular.” 
As more and more people ask questions about how we as a society grow and raise our food, it is important for consumers to understand GM seeds. Farmers and ranchers have choices and ultimately they select the best practice that fits their business. In addition, consumers have the right to choose what foods they want. Food from GM seeds has the same nutritional characteristics as food from seeds produced through conventional breeding, including organic crops. It is inaccurate to categorize food from GM seeds as harmful to human health because it simply has not been proven. USFRA encourages all consumers to turn to trustworthy, scientifically valid sources of information.

BENEFITS TO FARMERS
Producing More, With Less
•

•

GMO seeds are overwhelmingly embraced by American farmers. Roughly 90 percent
of corn, cotton, and soybeans grown in the U.S. are improved using biotechnology to
help farmers manage devastating insects, weeds, and weather conditions. Farmers
are also choosing biotechnology to grow crops such as alfalfa, papaya, sugarbeets,
squash and canola. Technology allows farmers to produce more food, using less land
and few chemicals, while conserving soil, water, and on-farm energy.
Today’s traits are only the first in a pipeline that focus on delivering high yields in tough
environmental conditions. Additional GMOs with novel genetic mechanisms for
advanced drought tolerance are being developed, as are crops that can tolerate
extreme heat, sunlight, and high levels of salt in the soil.

Improved Farm Incomes
•

•

Globally, farmers choosing to grow GMOs have seen net economic benefits at the farm
level amounting to $18.8 billion in 2012 and $116.6 billion between 1996 and 2012. Of
the total farm income benefit, 60 percent has been due to yield gains, with the balance
arising from reductions in production costs, such as money saved on fuel and crop
production.
USDA estimates that the adoption of herbicide tolerant seeds is associated with an
increase in off-farm household income as more efficient production practices allow farm
families to pursue other sources of income.

New Opportunities for Developing-World Farmers
•

•

Farmers in the developing world, just like those in the U.S.,use GMO seeds. In 2013,
the crops produced by these seeds are being grown in 27 countries (19 of which are
developing countries) by more than 18 million farmers. For farmers in developing
countries, efficiencies associated with biotechnology increase farm incomes and free
up time to pursue education or hold other jobs – a significant benefit for women farmers
in Africa.
According to the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), food insecurity
in sub-Saharan Africa remains a persistent and daunting challenge with 230 million
Africans – 20 percent of the continent’s population –classified as hungry. CSIS notes
that agricultural productivity, including the use of GMOs, is critical to meeting the
continent’s food security needs, as farmers grapple with climate variability, degradation
of soil and water resources, persistent pests and crop diseases, and land constraints.

  

  

  

  

  

BENEFITS TO CONSUMERS
Affordable Food
•

•

GMOs Keep Food Affordable. They require less water and fewer chemical
applications than conventional crops, and they are better able to survive drought,
weeds, and insects. With larger, more reliable harvests, studies show that certain
food products (corn, soybeans, and derivatives) would cost 6 to 10 percent more if
biotechnology was not available.
GMO Labeling – A $500 Hit on Families. According to a recent study by economists
at Cornell University, mandatory GMO labeling will raise food costs for American
families by an average of $500 per year. That is because farmers and food producers
would need to build an enormously expensive new supply chain system to track GMO
crops from seed to store shelves, incurring costs that would be passed along to
American consumers.

A Future of Healthier and More Nutritious Food
•

•

•

“Golden Rice” and Provitamin A Enrichment. Vitamin A deficiency is a leading
cause of blindness in the developing world and is particularly prevalent among
children. Scientists have fortified rice grains with beta-carotene (provitamin A), which
is found naturally in carrots, sweet potatoes, and other fruits and vegetables. Putting it
into a staple grain that serves as the primary food of billions of people will greatly
improve the nutritional value of their diet. The crop is awaiting approval in the
Philippines.
A Tool for Fighting Obesity. Fats and oils are essential parts of our diet.
Agricultural biotechnology has been used to develop soybean varieties that have a
healthier fatty acid profile. Some contain more oleic acid – a monounsaturated fatty
acid found in olive oil. Another has an increased level of omega-3 fatty acids, which
are the oils in fish thought to be associated with heart health.
Better fruits and vegetables. Scientists have done work that could, in the future,
lead to fruits and vegetables that cost less, offer better nutrition, and maintain postharvest quality longer, which would be a boon to people in underserved
neighborhoods and food deserts.

  

BENEFITS TO THE U.S. ECONOMY
•
•
•

U.S. farm revenues from GMO crops were roughly $76 billion in 2010.
According to USDA, agriculture is responsible for one out of every 12 jobs in the U.S.
Agricultural exports reached record sales in 2013 of $144 billion, resulting in a $37 billion
trade surplus.

  

BENEFITS TO OUR ENVIRONMENT
Fewer Chemical Applications
•

Data show that, since the year 1996, GMO crops have reduced pesticide applications
on farms by 8.8%.

Improving Water Quality
•

Herbicide tolerant GMO crops allow the widespread use of “no-till” agriculture, which
decreases soil erosion in the U.S. by at least one billion tons per year. This, in turn,
improves water quality by decreasing sedimentation and runoff of nitrogen and
phosphorous.

Reducing Greenhouse Gases
•

“No-till” and reduced-till farming practices improve carbon storage, cut on-farm fuel
consumption in the U.S. from five gallons per acre to one gallon per acre, and reduce
agriculture’s overall greenhouse gas footprint. In 2012, environmental improvements
associated with the global use of GMOs were equivalent to removing 11.9 million cars
from the road for one year.

  

  

BENEFITS FOR U.S. FOOD AND NATIONAL SECURITY
POLICY
•

•

•

•

Currently, nearly 2 billion people on our planet are malnourished. According to the United
Nations, the global population will reach over 9.6 billion in the year 2050, which places an
imperative on finding ways to meet daily human caloric needs in an environmentally
sustainable way.
According to many experts, including those with the State Department who are most
closely tied to food security, it will be necessary for farmers to produce as much food in the
next 50 years as was produced in all previously recorded history. Science, innovation,
and precision will be required to produce this amount of food without destroying the
environment.
According to a report by the Wilson Center and USAID, unanticipated food price rises
frequently provide a spark for unrest and the conflict among groups competing to control
the natural resources needed for food production can catalyze conflict. Social, political, or
economic inequities that affect people’s food security can also exacerbate grievances and
build momentum toward conflict.
If we do not embrace agricultural and food science & innovation, what does that mean for
U.S. foreign and military policy 10, 50, or 100 years from now?
This year, GMO Answers has placed a special focus on how GMOs can benefit our environment. We’ve released six infographics throughout the year addressing some of the most common environmental issues, and explained how GMO technology can actually help allay negative environmental impacts. 
Back in June, we launched the first in the series, an infographic showing the impact of GMOs on maximizing current land use. Contrary to myths about GMOs hurting the environment, GMOs allow farmers to preserve the land while doing more with less resources. 
The second in this series was released in July, highlighting the positive impact GMOs can have on preserving habitats and ecosystems. GM crops increase productivity on the world’s 3.7 billion acres of arable land, which helps to prevent deforestation and conserve biodiversity. 
Our third infographic, released in August, focuses on water conservation. Advancements in biotechnology such as drought-tolerant crops are one solution helping farmers use less water and reduce irrigation needs. 
September’s air quality infographic was the fourth in our series on how GMOs can help the environment.  Advances in crop biotechnology are helping farmers reduce carbon emissions and make agricultural production more sustainable. 
Producing enough food to meet the needs of a growing global population, while limiting our impact on the environment is undoubtedly one of the biggest challenges of our time. November’s infographic, Reducing Food Loss and Waste, illustrates how GMOs can be a critical part of the solution to reducing the amount of food sent to landfills and decreasing greenhouse gas emissions. 
This month, we released our sixth and final infographic of the year, GMOs Help Improve Soil Health. Healthy soil is fundamental for crop growth and food production. Herbicide-tolerant GM crops enable farmers to till — or turn over and break up the soil — less often, preserving topsoil and helping to prevent erosion.

Genetically modified (GM) foods for human consumption have long been a subject of intense public debate, as well as academic research. 
In our upcoming article in the Journal of Commercial Biotechnology, we show that consumers’ attitudes toward GM foods, their willingness to purchase them and the price they are willing to pay could be significantly improved if GM products had a direct benefit to them personally. 
Our findings at the University of Saskatchewan’s Edwards School of Business have the potential to change how agriculture biotechnology companies promote their products —while also creating significant value. 
Particularly, we found that consumers are willing to accept and pay premiums for GM foods that have value that’s personally relevant to them. 
In other words, changing the value proposition from industry-centric to consumer-centric may help to mitigate the negatives associated with GM food. 
Food insecurity is critical 
In 2009, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations identified global food security as an increasingly critical issue as the world population grows, and said that meeting the growing demand for food will require agricultural biotechnology. Therefore it’s necessary to build widespread consumer support for GM foods. 
Creating GM food with direct consumer benefits could play a pivotal role in gaining such support. Not only does promoting direct consumer benefits have the potential to change perceptions, as shown by our study’s data, it may also be a profitable endeavour. 
We surveyed 750 Canadian consumers on different ways of presenting GM foods. 
The first group of consumers saw ads for GM foods that promoted several industry-oriented benefits that might indirectly appeal to consumers, such as higher yield, less pesticide usage and enhanced global food supply. These messages were similar to those typically promoted by GM food proponents. 
The second group of consumers saw ads focusing on direct consumer benefits, such as better taste and enhanced nutrition. 
The third group of consumers saw ads for GM foods that promoted both direct and indirect consumer benefits. 
The result of the survey showed that, not surprisingly, the participants in the first group were less inclined to buy GM foods even at a price that was significantly lower than comparable non-GM foods. 
The consumers who were accepting of GM foods appreciated that GM technology had positive benefits and was creating value. However, they believed that the technology has only benefited the industry, and demanded that a portion of the value is passed onto the consumers. 
In contrast, the participants who were presented a value proposition that directly benefited both the industry and consumers reported better attitudes toward GM foods, expressed higher purchase intentions —and they were willing to pay a premium for such products. 
Why consumers do, or don’t, accept GM foods 
These findings suggest that how consumers assess the value of GM foods to themselves personally, as opposed to solely how or why the food is made, is fundamental to consumers’ attitudes, purchase intentions and willingness to pay. 
Many previous studies have examined consumer perceptions of GM foods and explored why or why not consumers were reluctant to accept them. 
A 2016 study conducted meta-analyses that reviewed hundreds of prior studies and how consumers’ personal characteristics could influence their acceptance of GM food. Those factors included gender (men might be more likely to accept genetically modified foods than women), education, income (consumers with higher income might be less likely to accept GM foods), prior knowledge and family situations, etc. 
In other words, the emphasis has been on figuring out how to change consumers so that they would accept GM foods. 
But our research points to the need for the GM industry to change how it’s promoting the products, and to begin producing foods that directly benefit consumers. The agricultural biotechnology industry needs to place consumer interests at the centre of their focus, not only at the time of selling their products, but also during the research and development processes. 
Indeed, in a previous University of Saskatchewan study, we found that in Canada, consumer-oriented biotechnology companies generally outperform those that aren’t consumer-oriented. 
Healthier rice 
The idea of a second generation of GM products — the kind that could hold real appeal to consumers — is now gaining momentum. 
Nonetheless, promoting direct consumer benefits is not a total panacea. 
Even while successfully showing consumers how GM foods can benefit them personally, there were still a substantial portion of the participants in our study (35 per cent to 50 per cent, depending on the products presented) who refuse to purchase GM foods no matter the price. 
This indicates that consumer acceptance of GM foods is a complicated matter. There’s still a long road ahead to convince shoppers at the grocery stores to consider genetically modified foods as personally beneficial.

Impacts of Genetically-Modified
Crops and Seeds on Farmers
Prepared by David Kruft, Legal Research Assistant
November 2001

I. Introduction
The agriculture industry has traditionally been supportive of technological advancement,
particularly in the field of genetic crop improvement.1 For decades, the industry has been
mixing naturally the genetic traits of seeds in the search for particularly robust varieties.
Genetically-modified (GM) seeds are a significant step forward in the production of
agricultural crops. GM seeds are seeds that have been modified to contain specific
characteristics such as resistance to herbicides (in the case of "Roundup Ready" products)
or resistance to pests (in the case of Bt corn). But the method of modification used with
GM seeds varies from the traditional method in an important respect: the genes have not
been modified over generations of cross-fertilization, but rather inserted directly into the
DNA of the seed.2 Although this method is more efficient, critics fear that the result — a
"novel gene combination" — may have health or environmental impacts that are not
being adequately addressed.3 As a result, the technology is surrounded by significant
controversy.
The reaction of farmers to this new technology has been mixed. Some farmers have
quickly adopted the technology.4 Other farmers, mindful of the controversy surrounding
GM products, have hesitated to use GM seeds as part of their agricultural operations.
Farmers should understand both the benefits and concerns that are raised by the use of
GM seeds. Benefits of the technology include increased crop yields, diminished use of
pesticides and herbicides, and increased profits. Concerns that farmers should address
before adopting the technology include the private contractual relations between farmers
and seed companies, the environmental impacts of the technology, and the potential
impacts of consumer concerns (both domestic and international) on the market for GM
products.
This paper describes the benefits that GM seeds can provide to farmers, as well as the
concerns that farmers should address before utilizing these seeds. It is intended only as a
general introduction to these benefits and concerns. The information contained in this
paper should not be considered legal advice.

II. Benefits
A.
Increased crop yields
There is an expectation widely held by those in agriculture that GM seeds will increase

the yields of farmers that adopt the technology. Although there is not yet a large volume
of research regarding the impact of biotechnology on crop yields and returns, the research
that is available supports this expectation.
In a study using 1997 data, the Economic Research Service (ERS) found a statistically
significant relationship between increased crop yields and increased adoption of
herbicide- and pesticide-tolerant crop seeds.5 The ERS study found that crop yields
"significantly increased" when farmers adopted herbicide-tolerant cotton and Bt cotton.6
The use of herbicide-tolerant soybeans resulted in a "small increase" in crop yields.
Another study performed by Iowa State University found that Bt crops out-yielded nonBt crops. The university studied 377 fields and estimated that crops grown from GM
seeds yielded 160.4 bushels of Bt corn per field, while crops grown from non-GM seeds
yielded 147.7 per field.
B. Fewer applications of pesticides and herbicides
Similarly, farmers expect that, as adoption of GM seeds increases, the use of
chemical pesticides and herbicides (and the costs associated with their
application) will decrease. Again, the research that is available generally supports
this expectation.
The study by ERS found a decrease of pesticide and herbicide use when farmers
adopted GM seeds. The decrease in pesticide use was significant.9 This decrease
in herbicide use was also significant (except for the herbicide glysophate, for
which the research revealed a significant increase).10
Other studies have not found a clear connection between the use of GM seeds and
decreased chemical use. For instance, the Iowa State University study discussed
above found that farmers' use of pesticides on GM crops remained "surprisingly
large." Farmers applied pesticides on 18% of non-GM crops and 12% of GM
crops.11

C.
Increased profits
In general, studies indicate that farmers' profits increase as they adopt GM seeds.
The ERS study found that in most cases there is a statistically significant
relationship between an increase in the use of GM seeds and an increase in net
returns from farming operations.12 For example, the service found that, on
average, GM soybean crops produced a net value of $208.42 per planted acre,
while other crops produced a value of $191.56 per planted acre.13 The service also
found a "significant increase" in net returns for herbicide-tolerant cotton crops and
Bt cotton crops.
Other studies have reached similar results. Studies in Tennessee and Mississippi
found higher returns from herbicide-resistant soybeans than from conventional

soybeans. A North Carolina study indicated that GM soybeans yielded $6 more
per acre than traditional varieties.14

III. Concerns
A.

Contractual issues
The contracts that seed companies require that buyers of their GM seeds sign
when obtaining those seeds may disadvantage farmers. Seed companies have
invested significant funds in the research and development of GM seeds, and they
protect this investment through their contracts with agricultural growers.15 These
contracts aggressively protect the biotechnology company's rights to the seeds,
frame the context within which disputes may be settled, and limit the liability of
the company.16
1. Limited rights to retain and reuse seed
Under a private contract between a grower and a biotech company, the
grower's rights to the purchased seed are significantly limited. Such
contracts generally contain a "no saved seed" provision.17 This provision
prohibits growers from saving seed and/or reusing seed from GM crops.18
In effect, the provision requires growers of GM crops to make an annual
purchase of GM seeds.
A patent infringement case stemming from unauthorized saving of GM
seeds was recently tried in the Canadian courts.19 In this case, Monsanto
Company sued Percy Schmeiser, a local farmer, for saving and planting
GM seeds produced from pollen that had blown onto his fields from a
neighboring farm. Schmeiser himself had no contract with Monsanto. The
court found that the defendant planted seed saved from a field onto which
pollen from GM canola had blown. The court found further that Schmeiser
had engaged in these activities knowingly. This violated the patent
Monsanto held on the Roundup tolerant seed. Mr. Schmeiser was required
to deliver to Monsanto any remaining saved seed and to pay to Monsanto
the profits earned from the crops, plus interest.20
2. Binding arbitration
Often contracts between seed companies and private growers contain a
binding arbitration clause that requires all conflicts arising from
performance of the seed (or technological traits within the seed) to be
resolved through arbitration.21 This binding arbitration clause precludes
farmers from filing lawsuits.
Additionally, the farmer is constrained in terms of the time frame within
which he must raise a dispute. Under the contract, the grower is typically
given as little as 15 days from the day that the problem is first observed to
file a complaint with the seed company.22

3. Acceptance of limited liability
Contracts between seed companies and farmers sometimes contain a
clause that limits the "liability of [the seed company] to or any seller for
any and all losses, injury or damages resulting from the use or handling of
a product containing [the seed company's] gene technology shall be the
price paid by the grower for the quantity of such product involved, or at
the election of [the seed company] or any seller, the replacement of such
quantity. In no event shall [the seed company] or any seller be liable for
any incidental, consequential, special or punitive damages."23 Under such
a clause, if the use of GM seed has a negative impact on another aspect of
the farmer's operations, this clause precludes the farmer from recovering
any damages from the company in the event the use of the product causes
harm.
B. Environmental Concerns
1. Development of resistant weeds and insects
Farmers may worry that their use of GM seeds will create "superweeds" or
"superbugs" that, over time, become resistant to GM seeds and crops and
to other herbicides and pesticides. There is some research that suggests
that weeds and bugs could possibly evolve into resistant organisms. Gene
movement from crop to weed through pollen transfer has been
demonstrated for GM crops when the crop is grown near a closely related
weed species.24 Similarly, insects have, in the past, developed a resistance
to pesticides. A recent study documented a decreased susceptibility in
pests to the use of Bt as a sprayed pesticide.25
One particular strategy that has been developed to prevent the growth of
pests resistant to GM seeds is "refuge areas." These areas are swaths of
land, planted with non-GM crops, which act as refuges for the pests. Pests
migrate to and remain in these areas, where they eat and breed. Since the
refuge area offers the pest adequate food, the pest has no need to become
resistant to GM crops, and thus the bulk of the crop is protected. The use
of refuge areas is now mandated by the EPA.26
2. Difficulty of preserving the identity of non-GM crops
Identity preservation in the field
Potential cross-pollination of GM seeds onto non-GM crops is also a
concern to farmers, particularly those farmers that certify their crops as
non-GM crops or organic crops. There is evidence that such crosspollination is already occurring.27 Plants with GM characteristics have
been found in conventional crops as well as in crops that have been grown
using only organic farming practices.28 Tests performed by Successful
Farming magazine found evidence of cross-pollination in both corn and
soybean crops.29

Cross-pollination raises the question of whether farmers planting GM
crops are liable to their non-GM neighbors for pollen drift. Traditionally,
farmers have not been liable for pollen drift onto neighboring properties.
However, farmers have been held liable under a theory of negligence for
pesticide use (including use of the pesticide Bt) if the drift from that
pesticide encroaches on neighboring lands.30 It remains to be seen whether
pollen drift from Bt corn and other GM crops will be found by the courts
to be actionable. Observers of the GM industry have suggested that a
cause of action may be pled under the theory of trespass or negligence, or
by analogizing the GM pollen drift to pesticide drift.31
Identity preservation from field to market
Another concern for farmers who are not currently planting GM crops is
preserving the identity of their non-GM crops as those crops move from
farm to market. Currently, bulk agricultural trading facilities are not able
to separate GM crops from traditional crops.32 Shipments of corn and
soybeans originating at these facilities cannot be guaranteed as "GM-free."
The importance of preserving the integrity of agricultural crops was
highlighted recently when Starlink corn was found in taco shells
distributed through a national company and in a corn product used by the
brewing industry.33 Starlink corn has not been approved for human
consumption. Although a recent study found no allergic reactions that
could be traced to consumption of the Starlink products,34 the larger
question — how the agricultural industry can accurately segregate GM
from non-GM produces — remains unanswered. The inability to segregate
crops may lead to a situation where all products are de-valued (particularly
in the international market, as discussed below) because they cannot be
certified GM-free.
3. Harm to other organisms
Another concern centering on impacts of biotechnology is possible harm
of GM seeds and crops to other, beneficial organisms. Very little research
exists to support this concern. A study performed at Cornell University
received significant publicity. This study indicated that a gene contained
within Bt corn can be harmful to the larvae of a monarch butterfly when
windblown onto milkweed leaves. But subsequent research has indicated
that the actual level of Bt on milkweed plants in a real-life scenario do not
reach the levels that produce a toxic results in the larvae.35
In fact, this later research suggests that the impact of Bt corn when
genetically placed in the corn is far less damaging to non-target insect
populations than spraying pesticides.36

C.

Concerns in marketing GM and non-GM products
1. Potential loss of domestic markets due to uncertainties
Although the domestic market has generally responded positively to GM
products, farmers fear that the uncertain effects of the products may
"spook" domestic consumers.37 This uncertainty is grounded in the
lingering public perception that GM crops pose a hidden health risk to
humans and that these crops are not being adequately regulated at the
federal level.
Uncertainties concerning human health risks
Critics say that the effects of GM products on human health are not yet
fully known. The largest threat to health is the presence of unknown
allergens in the GM food supply. There is some evidence that humans who
respond to allergens will respond similarly to that allergen when it is
transferred to another organism. For example, a recent study found that
people allergic to nuts reacted to GM soybeans into which a protein from a
Brazil nut had been inserted.38
Overall, however, there is little evidence that GM crops pose a significant
health hazard to consumers. The Centers for Disease Control recently
concluded a study in which it found no connection between a processed
food that contained a GM product and claimed allergic reactions.39
In addition, most observers of the GM industry recognize that the
domestic market has consumed GM products for years and, thus far, there
have been no accompanying health impacts.40 Nor can Americans stop
consuming these products. The large-scale adoption of GM crops,
combined with the accidental "drift" of GM seeds into supposedly nonGM fields has left the domestic user with little choice but to consume GM
crops.41
Uncertainties concerning the adequacy of regulatory safeguards
Critics of the GM industry claim that the domestic regulatory framework
is fragmented and uncoordinated. The regulatory safeguards currently in
place in the United States are enforced through three federal agencies: the
Environmental Protection Agency (which regulates pesticides, particularly
in their application to crops), the Food and Drug Administration (which
sets standards for food), and the Department of Agriculture (which also
sets standards and continuously inspects meat and poultry products).
Proponents of this system suggest that this three-tiered approach provides
accountability at several levels. Opponents of the current system state that

this fragmented approach weakens the efficacy of the regulatory scheme
and allows some products to fall through the cracks.
Certainly, the largest controversy surrounding the regulation of GM foods
has been labeling. Currently, the FDA requires labeling only when the
food product has been changed in its composition, safety, or nutritional
quality. FDA regulates the product, not the process by which that product
is created. Biotechnology companies argue that, because GM foods are
ultimately comprised of the same nutritional contents, the majority of
these foods need not be labeled.42 Whether domestic consumers will
demand that GM foods be labeled — or refuse to consume these foods
until they are labeled — remains to be seen.
2. Current problems with international markets
GM crops are not universally accepted throughout the international
market. Trading blocs such as the European Union (EU) have banned the
import of crops with inserted genes, citing concerns about human health
and the environment.43 The EU has thus far not been forced to accept GM
crops because it has other sources of supply rather than the United States.
Brazil, for example, does not allow the use of GM crops, and remains a
viable source of supply for those countries that will not import GM
crops.44
The hesitancy of the United States' international trading partners to accept
GM crops impacts the marketability of these crops. With good reason,
farmers fear losing the ability to sell commodities to these partners. The
financial impacts have been significant. In 1996, American exports of corn
and soybeans to the EU totaled $3 billion. In 2000, these exports had
dropped to $1 billion.45 Further actions on the part of the EU to regulate
American imports may have a further impact on farmers.46

IV. Conclusions
Perhaps the only conclusion to be drawn from a consideration of the benefits and
concerns raised by GM seeds is that neither full-scale adoption nor full-scale rejection is
a viable option. The technology may be more appropriate for farmers that have difficulty
spraying pesticides and herbicides. GM seeds may work well for farm areas that are
inaccessible to tractors or close to water bodies, or in places where winds are high.
Conversely, GM seeds may be least appropriate for farmers who are particularly reliant
on a stable market. The uncertainty surrounding consumer acceptance of GM products,
particularly in foreign markets, is a risk that may simply be unacceptable to some
farmers.

Certainly, GM seeds are a revolutionary technology in the agricultural industry.
Certainly, too, the potential benefits of these seeds promise to be considerable. But an
uneducated acceptance of this technology by farmers is not the proper response. The
technology of GM seeds and the attendant legal issues raise concerns that may work
against an individual farmer. The best response of every farmer is to educate himself
about this technology and to carefully read all legal documents before deciding to plant
GM seeds. It is hoped that this paper might be a tool in that education process.

Of course, the seed companies also protect their investment by applying for and
litigating patent rights. Patenting plant genes is an area of the law currently in flux. See

States Supreme Court Cases. Seed companies protect these patents in the context of
relations with individual growers by relying on their contractual relations with each
grower.

What Independent Experts are Saying about GM Crops 
Independent experts and scientific organizations worldwide stand behind the safety and are supportive of the use of GM crops. This section provides a few quotes and links to comments from various individuals and organizations. 
Health and Wellness Organizations 
“The science is quite clear: crop improvement by the modern molecular techniques of biotechnology is safe.” 
“Civilization rests on people’s ability to modify plants to make them more suitable as food, feed and fiber plants and all of these modifications are genetic.” 
“Bioengineered foods have been consumed for close to 20 years, and during that time, no overt consequences on human health have been reported and/or substantiated in the peer-reviewed literature.” 
American Medical Association, 2012 
“GM foods currently available on the international market have passed risk assessments and are not likely to present risks for human health. In addition, no effects on human health have been shown as a result of the consumption of such foods by the general population in the countries where they have been approved.” 
“…the study committee found no substantiated evidence of a difference in risks to human health between currently commercialized genetically engineered (GE) crops and conventionally bred crops, nor did it find conclusive cause-and-effect evidence of environmental problems from the GE crops.” 
“Far from presenting a threat to the public health, GM crops in many cases improve it. The ASCB vigorously supports research and development in the area of genetically engineered organisms, including the development of genetically modified (GM) crop plants.” 
“Far from presenting a threat to the public health, GM crops in many cases improve it. The ASCB vigorously supports research and development in the area of genetically engineered organisms, including the development of genetically modified (GM) crop plants.” 
American Society of Cell Biology, 2009 
People of Interest 
“Any private company has the right to require its suppliers to meet labeling standards it chooses to set, and consumers have a right to know what’s in the food they are buying. But there is no reliable evidence that genetically modified foods now on the market pose any risk to consumers.” 
"The world faces a choice, by spending a relatively little amount of money on proven solutions, we can help poor farmers feed themselves and their families and continue writing the story of a steadily more equitable world. Or we can decide to tolerate a very different world in which one in seven people needlessly lives on the edge of starvation." 
“The resilience we need for the future will be delivered by smart plant breeding – and that’s all GM is.” 
British Parliament member, George Freeman in Forbes article, 2012 
“The people believe there is something unsafe with this technology whereas, in fact, it’s safer than the conventional technology it superseded. People believe that there is some environmental harm implicit in genetic engineering, and the reality is it can be used very powerful to benefit the environment.” 
British environment campaigner Mark Lynas (formerly anti-GMO), Business Mirror article, 2013 
Industry/Academia 
“Use of biotech plants can produce more food on less land, by reducing the amount of crops lost to disease and pests. It can reduce CO2 emissions from the farming process, the amount of pesticides used to produce foods, and in the future, the amount of water needed to grow crops.” 
“According IFIC’s 2008 Food Biotechnology: A Study of US Consumer Trends, the majority (53 percent) of consumers have neutral impressions of plant biotechnology.” 
“Based on strong scientific evidence and consensus among a broad representation of scientific and governmental bodies, there is no known food safety concern related to consuming food produced through biotechnology. A number of food and health organizations such as the American Medical Association and the Institute of Food Technologists recognize and support the use of food biotechnology.” 
“Foods derived from GM crops have undergone more testing than any other food in history. Before entering the marketplace, they are assessed using guidelines issued by several international scientific agencies such as the World Health Organization, the Food and Agriculture Organization, and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. 
“Foods derived from GM plants are safe. Major issues and safety concerns on the biosafety of foods derived from GM plants have been addressed. International agencies such as the Food and Agriculture Organization, World Health Organization, the European Commission, the French Academy of Medicine, the American Medical Association, and the American Society of Toxicology have reviewed these health issues and have come to an agreement that GM foods are safe for human health.” 
"There is broad scientiﬁc consensus that genetically engineered crops currently on the market are safe to eat. After 14 years of cultivation and a cumulative total of 2 billion acres planted, no adverse health or environmental effects have resulted from commercialization of genetically engineered crops." 
“Improvements in water quality could prove to be the largest single benefit of GE crops, the report says. Insecticide use has declined since GE crops were introduced, and farmers who grow GE crops use fewer insecticides and herbicides that linger in soil and waterways.” 
“In many cases, farmers who have adopted the use of GE crops have either lower production costs or higher yields, or sometimes both, due to more cost-effective weed and insect control and fewer losses from insect damage, the report says.” 
“The guys who developed [Golden Rice] did it for the right reasons. They really were outraged by micronutrient deficiencies. They were out there in the rice paddies and in the villages. Every one of the Rockefeller Foundation meetings was in the developing world, and we were out there, learning things with these people.” 
“The other thing [opponents are] concerned about is, what is it doing to you? There’s this idea that somehow wild crop plants are more natural or better for you, and that’s completely untrue.” 
“[GM technology] is actually an environmentally friendly technology that reduces the chemical load. We’ve seen that in spades in China and India where they’ve adopted GM cotton, and its reduced farmer deaths from pesticide poisoning, and it’s really helped the environment over there. And I think you’re right. The average consumer is unaware of the environmental benefits. You only hear about the possible environmental risks.” 
“The Institute of Food Science & Technology issued a statement saying genetic modification can significantly improve the quantity and quality of the world’s food supply.” 
Institute of Food Science & Technology, 2008 
Regulatory 
“Foods from genetically engineered plants must meet the same requirements, including safety requirements, as foods from traditionally bred plants. FDA has a consultation process that encourages developers of genetically engineered plants to consult with FDA before marketing their products. This process helps developers determine the necessary steps to ensure their food products are safe and lawful. The goal of the consultation process is to ensure that any safety or other regulatory issues related to a food product are resolved before commercial distribution. Foods from genetically engineered plants intended to be grown in the United States that have been evaluated by FDA through the consultation process have not gone on the market until the FDA’s questions about the safety of such products have been resolved. 
U.S. Food and Drug Administration, 2013 
“The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) work to ensure that crops produced through genetic engineering for commercial use are properly tested and studied to make sure they pose no significant risk to consumers or the environment.” 
“To put these considerations in perspective, it is useful to note that while the particular biotech traits being used are often new to crops in that they often do not come from plants (many are from bacteria and viruses), the same basic types of traits often can be found naturally in most plants. These basic traits, like insect and disease resistance, have allowed plants to survive and evolve over time.” 
“GM crops have been subject to more testing worldwide than any other new crops, and have been declared as safe as conventionally bred crops by scientific and food safety authorities worldwide.” 
The controversy surrounding genetically modified organisms is very heated and often political. If one were to believe all the naysayers, GMOs will leave all but the richest few humans dying of starvation in a matter of a decade. As any savvy consumer knows, however, there are two sides to every story. There are plenty of good reasons for the investment of time and money into GMOs. 
What is Genetic Modification? 
Genetic modification is the science of replacing or adding genes from one organism to another to produce a beneficial result. Unlike selective breeding, which uses organisms that are very similar, genetic modification can use rather disparate plants and animals to get results. One example involves scientists who inserted daffodil and bacterial DNA into rice to give it a higher beta-carotene content. Daffodils and bacteria could never be cross-pollinated with rice using traditional breeding methods. 
Benefits to Producers 
GMOs can have many benefits for food producers. Plants can be designed to be insect-resistant, heartier or to grow under more extreme conditions. Animals can be modified to give more meat or milk, or to grow faster. This results in higher yields for farmers and better products. One example is slow-ripening tomatoes, which can be stored longer, hold up better to transportation and still provide superior taste and texture for consumers and manufacturers. 
In places where food is scarce or difficult to grow, plants and animals can be modified to provide more nutrients and grow better under harsh conditions. Scientists have added vitamins and minerals to staples like rice and corn to fight malnourishment in underdeveloped countries. Plants are more drought-resistant and easier to grow. Many plants are designed to use less pesticides and chemicals to grow, which means less exposure to these potentially toxic substances for farmers and consumers. 
Benefits to the Environment 
Many GMOs are tailored for specific environmental conditions, which means saving water in drought-prone areas and less use of chemicals. Higher yields and more efficient growth mean that the same amount of food is produced on less land, using fewer natural resources. Plants and animals become resistant to certain environmentally specific pathogens and insects, which reduces the chance of losing a crop to disease.

Mark Lynas spent years destroying genetically modified crops in the name of the environment. Now he's told the world – and his fellow activists – that he was wrong. So why did he change his mind? And does he have any friends left? 
Sat 9 Mar 2013 22.00 GMT First published on Sat 9 Mar 2013 22.00 GMT 
What was that line in Lord of the Flies? When Roger decides to kill Piggy? He makes that irreversible transgression with something like "a sense of delirious abandonment". Mark Lynas couldn't quite remember, but that's exactly how he felt as he walked on to the stage, in the mid-morning of 3 January, to make his dramatic speech. The night before he'd paced among the farmers and agriculture experts who would be his audience, thinking: "These people have no idea what I'm going to say." They were probably expecting to be bored and annoyed by the appearance of this raving eco-warrior. They didn't know that he'd taken the decision to stand in front of the people who were once his enemy – and confess. 
Back in the mid-90s he'd belonged to a "radical cell" of the anarchist, anti-capitalist environmental movement. He was influential – a co-founder of the magazine Corporate Watch who'd written the first article about the evils of Genetically Modified Organisms [GMOs] and Monsanto, the multinational biotech company whose work with GMOs was to become notorious. He was a law breaker. He'd pile into vans with gangs of up to 30 people and spend nights slashing GM crops with machetes. He was angry. He believed that the kind of people who'd attend the Oxford Farming Conference were ruining the world with greed. And now he was preparing to stand under spotlights and bow his head before them. He'd been nervous about it for days. He was scared that by the time his speech was over he wouldn't have any friends left at all. 
Once the crowd's mannered applause had died down, he began. "My lords, ladies and gentlemen. I want to start with some apologies, which I believe are most appropriate to this audience. For the record, here and upfront, I apologise for having spent several years ripping up GM crops. I'm also sorry that I helped to start the anti-GM movement back in the mid-1990s and that I thereby assisted in demonising an important technological option which can be used to benefit the environment. As an environmentalist, and someone who believes that everyone in this world has a right to a healthy and nutritious diet of their choosing, I could not have chosen a more counter-productive path. I now regret it completely." 
Fifty minutes later, the audience reacted with what he describes as "shocked applause". His website, on which he'd posted the text of his speech, crashed, unable to cope with the demand. He watched, on Twitter, as reaction spread around the world: Portugal, Spain, Chile, Argentina… Millions, he thinks, have now seen it. "It was a complete demolition, not just of anti-GMO but of the whole organic thing," he says. "For a lot of people, it was an 'Oh fuck' moment. They realised they'd been lied to, at a very profound level, by the very people they'd trusted." And what of his worst fear, that he wouldn't have any friends left at all? "Well," he smiles sadly. "That's probably what happened." 
Lynas, 39, lives in a modern terrace in a suburb of Oxford with his wife Maria, his puppy Scout and his children Tom, eight, and Rosa, six. He's handsome and fashionably presented, but in a strangely featureless way, like one of those members of Coldplay whose name nobody can remember. He gives me a cup of tea and leads me down towards his shed, with its sunken sofa, dusty curtains and shelves of sun-bleached books. He's worried about the interview and peppered me with questions beforehand: who was my editor? How many words would it be? Who was the photographer? Why did I want to write it? His anxiety is not surprising. Lynas's speech made the news internationally and, along with it, "all the hate started coming through". He found himself accused of being in the pay of Monsanto which, he says, "shows that people think I have no integrity and look at me with complete contempt". 
In the days when his anger came from the opposite direction, Lynas was a member of an organisation that was "loosely called" Earth First! It told a dramatic story about the world, in which the forces of industrialism were conspiring to bring about "environmental apocalypse. Big corporations and capitalism in general were destroying the earth." Theirs was a plucky struggle against the monstrous machines of profit. "We were the protectors of the land and the inheritors of the natural forces," he says. "We were the pixies." 
Lynas first heard about the notion of genetically modifying crops in a Brighton squat in early 1996, at a meeting of about six activists that was lead by Jim Thomas, a campaigns director for Greenpeace. "He really opened my eyes to the awfulness of what Monsanto seemed to be doing," he says. "Something unnatural was being done to our food supply. Big corporations were using more chemicals so that they could take over the food chain." It inspired him to write his Corporate Watch story that was "the first on Monsanto, as far as I know". By the time of Earth First!'s next gathering, GMOs had "become the next big thing". Lynas lead the early workshops that spread the message further. "The people who consider themselves leaders in the anti-GM movement today, I trained them." 
By 1997 his anger had turned to action, and the first "decontamination actions" to destroy experimental GM crops took place. "We'd head out in a van with gardening tools, dark clothes, some cash and no ID." Arriving at around 2am, between 20 and 30 of them would work until dawn, "just going along the line", destroying the plants. 
It wasn't always this straightforward. One night while he was slashing through maize with a machete somewhere in the east of England, Lynas saw flashing lights and heard the barking of dogs. He dropped into the dirt and held still. "For some reason the police went right past me," he says. "I got out of there. I found my way through some woods to the train station. A lot of the others were attacked by dogs and arrested. It was quite scary. In an odd way, I'm quite law abiding. You know, I wear glasses. I don't want to get hit in the face with a truncheon. I'm not really into confrontational situations at all." Lynas played a crucial role at a sit-in, on 29 April 1998, at Monsanto's offices in High Wycombe. "I cased the joint, printed the leaflets and hired the buses," he says. 
It was around this time, however, that Lynas began to experience the first mild cramps of rebellion. He'd begun to notice a widespread denial in the people around him. The more he recognised it, the more it felt like hypocrisy. "Everyone thought of themselves as being tolerant and open-minded," he says. "But if you said something critical about them, you'd be in quite serious trouble." Trouble? "I don't think anyone would've attacked you physically. But you'd go back to your worst days at school, just feeling like the child that everyone hated. I don't really thrive in that sort of bully-boy atmosphere." 
The movement deluded itself about its non-hierarchical nature. It didn't have leaders or elections because, to them, democracy was a lie. "But there were leaders – of which I definitely wasn't one – and everyone else was the sheep, the cannon fodder. The people who could rabble-rouse and were the most radical would rise to the top." The irony of all this was that Earth First! became acutely hierarchical, and in the worst possible way, "because the hierarchy is nontransparent". 
A critical fracture between Lynas and his movement occurred after London's 2000 May Day riots, which he helped organise. A branch of McDonald's was attacked, a statue of Winston Churchill was given a grass Mohican, and the Cenotaph was graffitied. At a meeting of key individuals in a north London pub that followed "everyone was saying: 'This is great'," he remembers. "'We've shown the corporate media!'" Lynas, however, didn't agree. "I thought it was a disaster. Everything we'd been trying to achieve was undermined by all the violence and window smashing. It just alienated people. I thought I'd be honest about it. Everyone looked at me in complete horror, shock and contempt." How did that feel? "Deeply hostile, and deeply limiting, actually. Tolerance and open-mindedness were qualities that people paid lip service to but were not really valued. That was one of the last meetings I went to." 
Lynas had an unusual childhood, being born in Fiji and schooled for three years in Peru. His father was a scientist – a geologist who did mapping for the government – and yet was politically assertive enough to emigrate to Spain in the mid-1980s because of Margaret Thatcher. Lynas remembers Nicaraguan folk bands staying as house guests. Today, his parents live in North Wales. "They have a little organic farm. Post-organic, really. My dad's with me in arguing the need for biological solutions, like GM, to reduce chemical use." 
Lynas's metamorphosis gathered real pace when he started work on his 2004 bookHigh Tide. It concerned the consequences of manmade climate change and involved him touring the continents seeking out its effects. This was a cause he was happy to be swept into: climate change made a perfect subplot for his grand narrative about the world of evil capitalism ruining nature. But this new episode introduced a curious character – a nerdy stranger who would go on to corrupt the plot of his life entirely. "I didn't want my book to be just a series of anecdotes," he explains, "so I began researching the science. And I fell in love with it. I realised that science offers a window into truth that nothing else can." 
His embrace of evidence-based knowledge caused a problem. Many of his beliefs about GMOs were predicated on an extravagant dismissal of the scientific consensus. "The whole GM thing had been about criticising scientists, saying they were corrupt, corporate shills," he says. "And we definitely believed all those things. But I realised everything we were doing was deeply reductionist, basically saying: 'Scientists should shut down their labs and go and work in Tesco.' It was a kind of counter-enlightenment. People against a process." 
Lynas lived the next few years in a state of weird, gigantic dissonance. A 2005 column for the New Statesman, which expressed doubt about traditional anti-nuclear arguments, prompted activists that he knew to "write in, saying I'd ruined their lives". His next book, Six Degrees: Our Future in a Hotter Planet, won 2008's prestigious Royal Society prize for science writing. And yet he was still existing between narratives in a way that, inevitably, became excruciating. The last piece of "GM crap" he wrote was for theGuardian, the year of his award. "I knew at the time I didn't believe it," he says. "I wrote it in an internet café. I thought: 'God, I really need to have some sources for these things.' Then I thought: 'Fuck it.' I'd just had this stamp of approval from the scientific community. And then I'm writing this completely unscientific and hopelessly unintellectual thing. How embarrassing can you get?" 
In November 2010 he appeared on a Channel 4 documentary, What the Green Movement Got Wrong, and a live debate that followed. In the shows he defended GMOs and nuclear power. Afterwards, he says, a member of Greenpeace "was that close to me, shouting in my face. I literally left the studio with a bag over my head." Close friends felt betrayed. "George Monbiot sent me a really devastating email." He also fell out with the person who'd been best man at his wedding. "We'd been friends for 10 years. We still have no relationship." 
Lynas also experienced a more subtle realignment in his worldview. He'd been used to seeing the Green movement as the brave, scrappy underdogs. But the more he looked, the more little David began to resemble Goliath. "Just take the numbers," he says. "Greenpeace, the whole international group, is a $150m outfit [in fact, figures provided by Greenpeace show global income in 2011 as $313.4m]. Bigger than the World Trade Organisation, and much more influential in terms of determining how people think." For Lynas, the modern Green movement is one of undeniable force. It's changed the world "sometimes for the better", but not always. "The anti-nuclear movement is partly responsible for global warming," he says. "Everywhere, pretty much, where a nuclear plant was cancelled, a coal plant was built instead, and that's because of the anti-nuclear movement. The environmental movement has been very successful in regulating GM out of existence in some parts of the world." 
Lynas has been very critical of Greenpeace's policy towards a GM crop that's become totemic among campaigners. Golden rice is a crop that's been modified, by the insertion of the genes for the chemical beta-carotene, in an attempt to make it provide more vitamin A. "Vitamin-A deficiency is one of the leading causes of death in southeast Asia," says Lynas. "It's led to blindness and the death of about a quarter of a million people a year." Yet campaigners, including Greenpeace, lobbied against it. 
Greenpeace insists golden rice is a "waste of money" and an "ineffective tool… [that] is also environmentally irresponsible, poses risks to human health and compromises food security". For Lynas, its stance is "just superstition. There are tens of thousands of kids who are dead who wouldn't be dead otherwise. I don't see how you could put this any other way. Imagine if Monsanto had been culpable in the deaths of tens of thousands of children! It would be all over the Guardian." (Lynas later made the partial concession that "there have been technical hold-ups in the golden rice project, and you can't solely blame Greenpeace for the overregulation that is applied to GMOs".) 
Since his Oxford Farming Conference speech, some have launched attacks on Lynas's interpretation of the science. But the rebellion against his rebellion has also been personal. Some former associates have questioned his claim to have been an influential figure. Jim Thomas, the former Greenpeace activist who first told Lynas about GMOs and lived with him for a few months, says: "Lynas was a player, but not a very important player, and for a very short period of time. Maybe in his mind he was important, but I don't think anybody else saw him that way." Ultimately, says Thomas, "I feel saddened by the whole thing. He's built a very successful career on the back of portraying people who were his friends as unthinking." 
Lynas counters that he's unable to defend himself from charges he's exaggerated his role due the illegality of the acts he and his associates were complicit in. "People don't want their names mentioned," he says. But the attacks hurt. "I've been complaining to my wife, but she said: 'Don't feel sorry for yourself. You've insulted people at the deepest level of their values. You've done something completely wounding to their very sense of self.' This was a life's work for people I was close to, and as far as they're concerned I've tried to destroy it." 
As for Lynas's life's mission, the change has been everything and nothing. He might not be battling against corporations any more, but he still feels "as if I'm changing the world for the better in my own small way". 
Nevertheless, he speaks of the betrayal and subsequent loss of his friends as a tragedy – "but tragic in the Shakespearean sense that you could see it coming". Indeed, how much of his metamorphosis was inevitable? Can his mutiny really constitute a moral treachery when so much of it seemed to happen to him? He was, after all, born into a family of independent spirit, to a scientist father, who was also a political radical who deified the environment. Emotional rebellion became empirical rebellion, when a book project forced him from the "echo chamber" of Earth First!. 
And then, what should he do? Try to live with it all, hounded by the dissonance of his contradictions? Or speak up and brave whatever damage might be caused? His opponents, who mutter about his "successful career", despite his modest circumstances, deny the complexity of human motivation. Nobody is pure. But few do as he has done, and have the courage to doubt themselves with as much vigour as they've previously doubted others. 
Monsanto is one of the most controversial companies in the world. Here & Now's Jeremy Hobson conducts a wide-ranging conversation with, Hugh Grant,CEO of the agrochemical and biotech giant, about pesticides, genetically modified crops (GMOs) and the future of agriculture. This is part one of a two part interview. 
Why do you think Monsanto has become the ‘face of corporate evil’ in this country? 
“I think a piece of this comes with – we’re the market leader, the original inventor of a lot of these technologies and I think sometimes when you’re first out the gate, when you’re in a leadership position like that, you become the de facto spear catcher. I think for us that was maybe the genesis of this, and I think there’s a piece of, also, this – we’re right in the middle of this discussion on food and agriculture and the safety and security of food, so I understand some of the concern. But I think, nevertheless, there’s work to be done in explaining more clearly where food comes from and how food is produced.” 
What part of the concern do you understand? 
“I think in the U.S. today there is still a very significant misunderstanding about science. When you think about the consumer today, there’s more work to be done in helping to explain the science behind these technologies, so I think a lot of the concern comes through that. My experience has been, when you can explain what these products do and you can explain the extraordinary benefits that they bring to growers and to society, you usually meet a middle ground. That’s been my experience over the years.” 
On concerns about genetically engineered seeds 
“So it’s springtime in St. Louis, in a few weeks’ time, the Midwest will start planting crops, and those crops feed the world. This is the 20th spring that the U.S. has planted GMOs; it’s the 20th anniversary this year for biotech around the world. So billions of acres, trillions of meals served and not a single health concern, so I think the weight of science and, frankly, the evidence of practices is pretty clear on this.” 
So why are there still so many protests, in the U.S. and abroad, against genetically modified seeds? 
“I actually think it’s improving. I think the dialogue – so here’s the interesting thing, and it’s more evident today than I think it was 10 years ago. It doesn’t matter where you go, if you’ve got a party on the weekend there’s usually a conversation about food and food is front and center in many discussions, and any time there’s a conversation about food, usually Monsanto is at the table, and I think it’s a healthy thing, but I think of if you look, you know, GMOs have been around 20 years. If you think of it the next 30 years, we’re gonna have to figure out how to grow twice as much food on a shrinking footprint. We’re gonna have to figure out how to grow more on a smaller footprint worldwide and use less stuff. We’re gonna have to make agriculture much more sustainable, and I don’t think GMOs are the silver bullet there. I think there’s other things that we’re gonna have to figure out, how we look after soil better, how we use less water, but I see that conversation improving. The quality of that dialogue is improving and I think that’s cause for optimism.” 
You think by using genetically modified seeds, we can use less water when planting crops? 
“This is the conundrum. There’s three things that as a civilization we’re going to have to do simultaneously. We’ll have to do, I think within the lifetime of our children or for some of us our grandchildren, and the three things that we’ll have to figure out to do simultaneously are number one: How do we use less water in agriculture, because agriculture is gargling its way through about 70 percent of the world’s fresh water, so obviously we need to improve that. Number two: How do you change the slope in the curve of food security? Because as many parts of the world don’t have enough to eat, and Africa this year is heading into another famine. We see the front end of that right now. And number three: How do we help solve climate change? I think that the key in this is how you do three things at once. You can’t say ‘I solved food security, but I’m really sorry about water,’ or ‘I’m using less water, but I apologize about climate change.’ I think agriculture can contribute to all three, and I thing GMOs and microbials and better use of data, I think the convergence at hand for these technologies has a really important part to play in solving these three pieces.” 
Why is there a need for Monsanto to sue farmers that reuse their seeds instead of buying fresh ones every year? 
“Yes, one of these urban myths.” 
Is it an urban myth? You have sued farmers in Canada, and won. 
“Here’s the reality. We sell to about, in the U.S., a quarter of a million to a third of a million farmers every year. We’ve been selling to that same group for 20 years. So 20 times a third of a million, you’re about 7 million customers that we have sold to over the last two decades, and we will have sued less than 10 growers in that time. So any business - a business where you sue your customers isn’t really great for business. If you’re in a generational business where you’re selling to farmers and hoping to sell to their sons and daughters, that doesn’t really shake out. The reality is, and that’s why I call it a myth, growers buy fresh seed every year because fresh seed yields better crops. They’ve been doing that with corn since the 1940s. In fact, when America fed a war-torn Europe in the 1945 to 1950 time frame, America flipped to hybrids. You buy fresh hybrids every single year, and now the world has followed them. France followed America in the 1950s, Vietnam made the move in the 1970s, so it’s a nice soundbite, but the reality of agriculture is, you’re never going to force farmers into doing something that doesn’t make business sense, and they plant fresh seed because it yields more.” 
So if a farmer decided not to buy new seed and reuse their older ones, you would have a problem with that? 
“I’d have a problem with it, but the practice is 96 or 97 percent of them are planting, and corn, 100 percent of them plant fresh corn every year. Nobody stores corn because the second year you plant it, the yields are lousy. That’s the nature of a hybrid, and in soybeans you get disease, bugs and broken seed. So 95 or 97 percent of them are planting fresh seeds. The challenge of this is, there’s a piece of our technology in there, just in the same way as if you buy a DVD or a piece of recorded music, so there’s an expectation that we get paid for the investment we make. That’s a fair deal, and farmers honor that.” 
What would you say to the people that still, after this interview, dislike everything Monsanto does? 
“I think, I mean it’s a complex one. I’d ask people to take a step back, to think about our little blue planet, and think about food production, not just this harvest but for the next 20 or 30 harvests and think from the perspective of how are we going to feed a population that has grown significantly. The irony of the population growth and the life of their kids or grandkids, the irony is that the growth is going to come in many parts of the world that are largely or more affected by climate change. So the world is going to be warmer, dustier, drier and thirstier, and we are going to have to grow more stuff against that backdrop. I guess I would ask your listeners to think about how we’re going to produce more food and how we’re going to feed the world, and a lot of that is going to be done in the U.S., Brazil, Argentina and I think Mexico, and that food will be moved and we’re going to have to figure out how we apply technologies to do that in a much more sustainable manner. That’s a long answer, but I think the faster that we can get to a central dialogue rather than an either-or, that would be a healthy outcome for everybody I think.” 
Every activist dreams of ending world hunger. But could a corporation hated by the same activists be able to bring more sustainable agriculture to impoverished African nations? 
Monsanto is the leading producer of agricultural products designed to increase crop yields and reduce harvest volatility. These products fall into two distinct segments: herbicides and seeds. Like a pharmaceutical company, Monsanto invests heavily in R&D to develop products protected by intellectual property. These products are seeds modified through selective breeding and the insertion of genes from other species to gain traits such as resistance to herbicides and insecticides, improvement in yield, and reduction in water usage. Monsanto then bundles them with the herbicide products they are designed to resist, and sells them. 
Genetically modified (GM) seeds benefit farmers by increasing their productivity, with higher yields and less required labour offsetting the premium charged for the seeds. Further, in certain commodities, such as corn and canola, it is not economical to grow unmodified seeds. As with pharmaceuticals, the barriers to entry are high due to IP development costs. Monsanto currently has a competitive advantage over DuPont and Syngenta, the other major crop science firms, who rely on licensing Monsanto patents. 
Over the next 20 years, the global population will rise 17% to 8.4 billion people. Demands on agricultural productivity will rise as per capita food consumption in developing countries increases with prosperity. Monsanto is well positioned to deliver solutions to farmers worldwide. 
Shifting Soil 
Misinformation about Monsanto’s products and enforcement of intellectual property has garnered criticism from environmental and health activists. There is scientific consensus that Monsanto seeds are safe for consumption with regulatory approval from bodies including the Food and Drug Administration. Nevertheless, activists argue the long-term effects of GM foods are unknown, and call for mandatory consumer labelling on all products containing genetically altered crops. This would result in labelling on 70% of items in a typical North American supermarket.The risk inherent in Monsanto’s business can be seen from the EU’s introduction of mandatory consumer labels in 2004. Worried that GM foods would be less appealing to consumers, food manufacturers switched to higher cost non-GM ingredients. For example, Coca-Cola and Pepsi switched from GM high-fructose corn syrup to regular sugar. These decisions decimated Monsanto Europe, and in 2013 they stopped seeking regulatory approvals on the continent. 
Monsanto realizes 60% of their revenues in North America, where similar arguments seeking mandatory labelling are currently underway. To prevent this eventuality, Monsanto and their competitors engage in heavy lobbying. However, these decisions are predominantly outside of corporate control, so strategies to alleviate the potential damage a regulatory ruling could cause in the US should be employed. Monsanto should diversify revenues into international markets. 
Predicting the Weather 
Monsanto has already made moves to increase its competitive positioning. In the fall of 2013, Monsanto acquired Climate Corporation, a Silicon Valley start-up that has developed models to forecast the impact of weather and climate on agricultural development. By integrating these models with soil conditions and historic crop yields, they offer crop insurance to farmers. Their product, called Total Weather Insurance, automatically sends payment to the insured farmers as soon as certain weather conditions occur. This has the advantage of not requiring verification costs, unlike other crop insurance products. 
With this acquisition, Monsanto is looking to optimize profits by moving towards offering an integrated bundle of agriculture products and services. First, they provide advice tapping into the Climate Corporation’s expertise, on which crops to plant, and when to plant, fertilize, irrigate, spray, and harvest. Second, they sell seeds genetically optimized for particular climate locations, and herbicides to which these seeds are resistant. Finally, Monsanto offers insurance to reduce the risk of crop loss. The expansion into insurance in particular gives Monsanto the potential to capture market share from its competitors. Understanding its crop technology and advice will minimize the risk of crop loss. Further, a discount can be offered on insurance premiums if farmers plant and spray Monsanto products. The move to integrated services also affords Monsanto protection against patent expiry. The patent for Monsanto’s first generation Roundup soybeans is expiring in 2015. So far, about 50% of farmers have converted to their new Genuity Roundup seeds, but this remains a risk for future patent expiry. The other aspect of this integrated offering is providing seeds that are tailored specifically to the geography and soil of certain regions. Monsanto’s product pipeline includes a number of innovations that could have a substantial impact on agriculture in developing nations. Among the developments are drought resistant corn, and higher yielding wheat crops. These products coupled with this new full service business model have the potential to deliver a high adoption rate for new products. The opportunity for GM crops to improve agriculture in developing economies is substantial, especially because the current production in these countries is far less efficient than in countries with industrialized agriculture practices. 
Where to Plant? 
High economic growth, foreign direct investment and swelling populations make African countries prime hunting ground for savvy investors. In Sub-Saharan Africa, crop yields are the lowest in the world, creating opportunity for Monsanto’s products to have an enormous impact. Sub-Saharan corn farmers realize 2 tonnes per hectare, while North American growers are able to harvest close to 9 tonnes per hectare. Some of this disparity is explained by inefficient agricultural methods and limited technology in Africa, but part is also due to the lack of GM crops. As an example, the introduction of Monsanto corn in the Philippines, where agricultural sophistication was low at the time of introduction, increased yields by 24%. 
Monsanto already has a market share of 40% in South Africa, serving as a solid base for expansion to other countries. In order to spread fixed costs, develop a word of mouth reputation, and establish relationships with government and distributors, Monsanto should cluster its resources and target a specific country. Nigeria has the fastest growing market in Sub-Saharan Africa with a current population of 170 million projected to increase to 400 million by 2050, and current annual GDP growth of 7.6%, making it a prime candidate. Despite 60% of the current population working in agriculture, the country is still a net importer of food. The government estimates that only 10% of the arable land is optimally employed. Nigeria’s government recognizes the problem and Akinwumi Adesina, the Agriculture Minister, is taking an active role to promote rationalization and investment, including construction of a new fertilizer plant. In contrast to neighboring Uganda and Kenya, the government has not taken a stand against GM seeds. 
There are many hurdles to overcome in order for Monsanto to succeed in Africa, including the weak intellectual property protections, and an inability for farmers to finance their business needs. In the Indian market, farmers took on debt to purchase Monsanto seeds, and, after crop failures, hundreds of farmers committed suicide. Monsanto was blamed for these deaths. While this issue is far more complex, these accusations have been made because some farmers in the developing world have struggled to pay the higher prices of GM seeds particularly when adverse weather conditions precipitate crop failure. Incidents of this nature hurt Monsanto’s ability to penetrate already skeptical developing markets. 
Choosing the Crops 
Adoption of GM seeds and the economics of farming in Africa can increase seed costs by 35%, but improved yields lead to an increase in total profits. To successfully create these benefits in Nigeria, Monsanto must adapt to the unique dynamics of the developing African market, address IP risk, find a way to solve farmers’ inability to pay for Monsanto seeds, and ensure that farmers are using methods that facilitate the benefits of GM seeds. Monsanto’s business model in North America cannot simply be transplanted into a fundamentally different business environment. 
Funding the Purchase 
The first issue that Monsanto will face is overcoming farmers’ inability to pay for Monsanto seeds and related services. Given previous experience with farmer’s taking on debt to pay for Monsanto seeds, they should instead provide seeds to farmers for free. Monsanto would seek to recoup its costs from farmers at the end of the growing season, when they would take a share of the farmers’ revenues. 
Ancillary Services 
Further, Monsanto should leverage the resources Climate Corporation provides to actively offer farmers advice and best practices to ensure optimal yield. Not only will yield increases improve the revenues that Monsanto sees, but it will ensure that farmers see a clear benefit to the engagement with Monsanto, leading to a sustained relationship. 
Repayment Risk 
While this new inverted revenue model would help to drive adoption, there is a large repayment risk that Monsanto will be accepting. As such, Monsanto should expect to take losses on some first generation relationships with farmers; however, this will be a short-term pain. Rather than pursue the traditional route of suing these farmers, Monsanto should simply endure the loss and stop doing business with them. Over the long term, farmers will see the financial benefit of allying with Monsanto and unpaid debts will decrease. Monsanto can also decrease the downside risk by implementing a phased pilot approach, where they decrease the overall risk exposure in early stages of expansion by working with farmers that have a lower risk to default (larger farm size, willingness to adopt). This pilot project will set a precedent for neighbouring farmers and increase the amount of farmers wanting to do business with Monsanto. 
Payment risk can also be avoided through working with other organizations that buy food from farmers. By inserting itself in the selling process, Monsanto ensures that it can collect its payment by taking its cut out of the food buyer’s payment before passing it on to the farmers. 
New Products 
The potential value of this solution is furthered by Monsanto’s pipeline of new products, which have the potential to deliver extraordinary value in Africa’s drought stricken growing conditions. Monsanto and BASF are collaborating to produce stress resistant crops, including those, which can be grown with less water and under hot conditions. The current generation of these seeds are not effective enough to be commercially viable, but it is conceivable that within a decade Monsanto could possess a revolutionary new seed technology. If Monsanto establishes a distribution network and relationships now, it will be ideally positioned as these innovations reach market. 
Sowing the Seeds 
Economic historians argue that it was the advancement of agricultural techniques in eighteenth century Britain that brought about the industrial revolution. The application of enclosure, crop rotations, and selective breeding to farming freed up labour to work in more value added industries. Currently, 41% of Nigeria’s GDP is agriculture based, and by driving improvements in agricultural productivity, Monsanto can be an agent to stimulate economic growth in other areas. 
Through simple innovations in its business model, Monsanto has the opportunity to diversify away from its North American regulatory risks, increase overall revenues, and position the company for long-term success in a rapidly growing market.

More than 280 scientific and technical institutions support the safety of GM crops 
Currently there is a social and political controversy about the safety of foods produced from genetically modified (GM) crops, however, in the scientific community there is no dispute or controversy regarding the safety of these technology. To date, more than 3000 scientific studies [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8] have assessed the safety of these crops in terms of human health and environmental impact. These studies, together with several reviews performed on a case by case from regulatory agencies around the world, have enabled a solid and clear scientific consensus: GM crops have no more risk than those that have been developed by conventional breeding techniques. 
In addition, there is also extensive literature that compiles the socioeconomic and environmental benefits that transgenic crops have reported in 2 decades of commercialization [9,10]. 
This document brings together the public statements of technical and scientific institutions that adhere to this consensus. I made an update based on this document from ChileBio that initially included 40 official documents representing about 190 institutions – the document from ChileBio was subsequently updated in 2017 with the institutions and statements attached here. 
The update shows that 284 technical and scientific institutions recognize the safety of GM crops and their potential benefits. Interestingly a large part of these institutions are located in Europe, the continent that has put more obstacles to the commercialization of these crops. On the other hand, the countries with most organizations in favor of GM crops are United Kingdom (33), United States (25), Italy (23), Spain (16) and Germany (11). 
Actualmente existe a nivel social y político una polémica en torno a la seguridad de los alimentos transgénicos, los cuales han sido producidos a partir de cultivos genéticamente modificados (GM), sin embargo, a nivel científico no existe polémica o controversia respecto a la seguridad de esta tecnología. A la fecha, más de 3000 estudios científicos [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8] que han evaluado la seguridad de estos cultivosa nivel de salud humana e impacto ambiental, y estos, junto a diversas revisiones caso por caso de agencias regulatorias alrededor del mundo, han permitido establecer un consenso científico sólido y claro: los cultivos GM no presentan mayor riesgo que los que han sido desarrollados por técnicas de mejoramiento convencional.

After categorizing the different institutions from Africa (14), Asia (5), Europe (89), Latin America (9), North America (28), Oceania (7) and internationals (14), a total of 166 institutions was obtained. If we add the 101 academies and 27 scientific unions that signed the document of the International Council for Science (ICSU), we get a figure of 294 institutions.

However, in the current 121 national scientific institutions that are members of ICSU, 13 already appear on the categorization by continents – the academies of sciences of Australia, Brazil, Cameroon, Chile, Czech Republic, France, India, Kenya, Ghana, Vatican, Mexico, UK and United States, and these academies where members of ICSU before the document was signed in 2003. Therefore, if we subtract these 13 members, we get a figure of 281 institutions. 
But we must note that the European Academies Science Advisory Council (EASAC) is composed by 29 members, and 26 already appear on the categorization by continents or in the declaration of ICSU. So we must add the 3 remaining institutions (ALLEA, ‘Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts’, and the ‘Spanish Royal Academy of Sciences’) adding a final figure of 284. 
In conclusion, 284 technical and scientific institutions recognize that GM crops are not riskier than those produced by conventional breeding, and/or the potential benefits of these crops.

This is an excellently thorough piece of research work by the author. Anyone sensible challenge should be directed at what the quoted long litany of institutions state, not at the messenger!! The problem lies in the utter negation of the truth, facts and figures which are itchy like hot pepper in the eyes and sour mouths of anti-science cults. So they go on to attack the messengers in the typical mafia and Nazi-style well-documented by society. We in Africa — where such cultic fellows are in plenty even at universities – sprouting from their grandmother, the multinational campaigner (MNC) Greenpeace. This nasty militaristic/militia-styled MNC should be appropriately re-named “Green-war” abolished and its branches outlawed like India is doing. The “Greenwar” is a bioterrorist grouping that lays eggs and sows seeds of devil-kids like Donal E. Tiers who are cynics, skeptics, denialists, haters, techno-phobics (but purchase latest models of phones, computers and have fridges and freezers full of rotting food, some of it from GM-crops, yet keep displaying ugly GMO-freakness! What a world it would have been without such freaks. “Green-war” has misled society with lies manufactured by European and North America chemical multinational companies whose products are being threatened by GM technology e.g Bt (naturally-built defence mechanism for cotton and maize) that enable farmers grow the two normally large-scale plantation crops with reduced pesticide spraying. This reduced pesticide spraying is a huge loss to multi-billion chemical companies, which now sponsor the MNC Greenpeace to decampaign GM-technologies including where billion-population countries like India are vigorously adopting them. In USA, Canada, Brazil and China — lately Sudan and Cuba, large scale Bt-cotton and Bt-maize growing countries would be buying large amounts of pesticides in millions of tonnes with which to spray against stem-borers (in maize) and bollworms (in cotton). But thanks to molecular scientists, the Br-technology is saving the world of pesticides. Not surprisingly, because the anti-GM freaks are challenged by farmers’ rapid adoption of such GM-technologies as Bts, have turned around the great Indian Bt-Cotton story of harvesting larger amounts of cotton into a negative. They blatantly claim that because of Bt cotton, Indian farmers commit suicides!! U ask them what the connection, they craft it around crop losses and increased use of pesticides — look around for lie of Vendana Shiva (a diehard anti-GMO shiverer)!! What has been solved is what these evil-minded fellows turn into a problem for Indian Bt-cotton! Yet India’s poor, bad, unfair class system has deprived the largely subsistence farmers landless, hence to grow any crop including Bt and non-Bt cotton, for any losses occasioned by any factors including drought, flooding, bad seed, or utter failure to repay agricultural or any other loans borrowed for rent-land, leads to committing suicide. Some Indian farmers mortgage their internal body organs as security for renting land, and should their crop fail for any reason, the landlords demand for the body organ, to be sold. Why isn’t it Shiva and her likes’ campaign to deal with the actual/real causes of landliness since it is the problem. And instead they have coined lies and jumped onto what is easy prey — technology Bt Cotton!! Is Bt-cotton being grown by the Japanese, Americans and those with the world’s highest suicide rates? Is it Bt-cotton responsible for the high suicides rates in Russia, Europe, Australia, in Africa and the rest of Asia? The “Greenwar” has photo-shopped pictures of grotesque creatures depicted as products of genetic engineering, and in a more gullible world like Africa, farmers are suffering from vagaries of nature (devastating pests, diseases, drought) but fear adopting resistant GM seeds due to the evil handwork of Greenpeace and her evil kids. The world should wake up to destruction of GP. 
The anti-science crowd uses associations to substitute for proof. They apparently do not know much of the scientific method and run to legislatures instead of being educated. They say less is more and more is less and have no qualm about using radiation or mutagenic chemicals for development of new seed varieties and happily plant such seeds at their organic farms. 
If I am writing a book about the far off future and need a year with a solar eclipse, I can either poll out my Ouji board or ask the scientists. Carl Sagen warned us in his last book, Demon-Haunted world of this dumbing down of America and it is here in full force. These are the climate change and vaccine deniers who think a small group of poorly trained people know more than 90% of the scientists. They claim the recent report of U.S. National Academy of Sciences on GMO foods should be taken “just for what it is-a political statement” to support U.S. biotech companies. For me, I’ll go with the scientists. Some of the most promising new drugs are genetically engineered, and they want us to dump those, too. Billions of meals and billions of farm animals fed GMO products and not one documented case of illness. All this they want to ignore and go back to the Middle Ages.. 
Daniel, I am trying to find a few links to statements from some of these organizations. For now specifically the BMA and the Royal society from Canada. Can you assist. What appear to be links on the right of your list don’t work. 
Everyone gets on the internet, reads a few articles and related information from non-scientists. Then, they autonomously appoint themselves as experts. And all this on a full stomach, I might add, that is almost 100% due to the efforts of all the good science work that has been accomplished. 
Now Eric as promised, here is my pasted response for the day to all these folks: 
Of course you people are always right, and on a full stomach too. You Libbys are always right about this gmo issue and the other bad things that we are continually doing in agriculture. My goodness, we are so wicked, mean, and trying to destroy human kind. BTW lady, if you do not want me responding to your whining and naysayer nonsense, all you have to do is get off the blog. It’s simple, like my attitude toward all y’all Libbys. I guess that you also think it is too soon to be sure that all the other crop science work that has been accomplished by our ag science folks, is safe. Again, on a full stomach. From your comments, I’d guess that you also believe, if it didn’t come from you naysayers (and on that full stomach), that it is just not believable. About 3.75 B years from now when H. sapiens no longer exists, I’ll give your attitude some consideration. Until then, you can just kiss my grits (and they’re made from gmo corn). This is the ‘Libby Mentality’. Sad! Need to remove those genes from the ‘world gene pool’. 
I changed my mind, I’m not yet done for the day. These comments apply to all concerned experts: 
Andrea, I see that you are a financial analyst in NYC. But I’m curious, when did you become an agricultural scientist? Did you do it online or through the internet? Just asking. Also, I’m wondering if you have missed any meals lately? It’s easy to criticize everything that you eat, on a full stomach. Would you also be against all of our agronomic and agricultural technological advances if they didn’t exist, and a gallon of milk costs $10, potatoes cost $5 a pound, organic iceberg lettuce is already $4 a head, most vegetables and fruit would likely go up 10X (that is, if they were even available), oh, and meats of all kinds: gosh. The impact of these high prices to the consumer? And the consequences to being able to feed the world population? Likely, 75-90% of the current population would not be able to afford to have even a minimal, survivable diet. Even you NYC folks, with all your money, would likely be having to make extreme choices: you know, like paying the mortgage/rent or eating; paying for your kid’s private schooling or eating; paying for all of your fancy cars or eating; a few little economic considerations of that nature. 
I’m not quite finished here my dear. I’m also curious as to how all of your extensive genetics research and knowledge is coming along, in your scientific evaluation of the terrible consequences of genome science, that all the other ‘real scientists’ have unraveled and developed, and I might add here, for the betterment of human kind. Again, as I have asked so many times before, why is the use of genetics and genomic science so bad for agriculture, and so good for medicine/medical science? Have you bothered to try to learn (and this is key: to understand) even a tidbit of all the genomic science that is now in the public domain, following dedicated and peer reviewed research/findings? Have you? Do you really think that evolution and development of Eucaryotic organisms (plant or animals) over the last 3.8B years, has happened by chance. Oh, I want to be this genus and species, so I’ll start my own kind. Good grief, get real! Give me a break Andrea: tend to your financial analyst job and leave the agricultural and genomics science to the experts in the fields. Regards to NYC!!!! LOL! 
Now, I’m done for the day. Notice that keyword ‘day’.

Diversity of opinion and knowledge are key to the scientific method, and are therefore key to the way we hire. The more welcoming Monsanto becomes, the more opportunities we have to better serve farmers as they steward the land. 
An Overview of the Safety and Advantages of GM Foods 
Like you, Monsanto employees care about the food we buy at the store and feed to ourselves and our loved ones, and we are committed to developing products that contribute to safe and nutritious food choices. We place the highest priority on the safety of our products and conduct rigorous and comprehensive testing on each. In fact, seeds with GM traits have been tested more than any other crops in the history of agriculture – with no evidence of harm to humans or animals. In addition, governmental regulatory agencies, scientific organizations and leading health associations worldwide agree on the safety of GM crops. 
As a seed company, Monsanto employees breed, grow and sell seeds to farmers around the world. Because many of the foods we eat and products we use every day begin as seeds, the safety of each of Monsanto’s seeds – whether GM or conventional – is a top priority to each of us. 
After 30 years of research and assessments, the safety of GM crops is supported strongly by scientific evidence and the conclusions of the global scientific community. In fact, GM crops have been reviewed and tested more than any other crops in the history of agriculture and have been shown to be as safe as conventional crops. Following are three reasons why you can be confident in the safety of GM crops: 
1. For each potential GM product, our research teams conduct years of field trials and comprehensive testing to be scientifically certain the new trait and genetic modification have not changed the safety of the crop. 
From day one, our research teams prioritize product safety and would discontinue the development of any product that did not successfully pass each rigorous internal review and approval. For example, our researchers conduct numerous tests on the genetics, efficacy, nutritional characteristics, agronomic performance and environmental safety of each potential product. The researchers follow the requirements of scientific regulatory agencies and the guidelines of international agencies such as the World Health Organization (WHO), the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). 
Specifically for food safety, we compare and evaluate each of the key nutrients, as well as naturally occurring anti-nutrients and toxicants in the potential product to the conventional crop. We may compare the amount of protein, fat, ash, fiber, oil, carbohydrates, amino acids and fatty acids. Our researchers also conduct tests to ensure there are no new allergens. 
In the “Products: Product Safety” section of this website, we provide the Safety Summaries and a list of peer-reviewed safety publications for our products if you are interested in learning more about their safety profiles.. 
2. Independent groups of scientists at regulatory agencies worldwide then review all of the data for each potential product and make their own scientific assessment of its food, feed and environmental safety. 
Since GM crops were first commercialized in 1996 (1996-2014), regulatory agencies in over 60 countries have conducted extensive scientific reviews and confirmed the safety of GM crops with 3,083 approvals on 357 different GM traits in 27 crops. 
We make submissions to the agencies in the countries where we want to be able to sell our product or where the crop is commonly imported. Regulatory agencies in each country must approve a potential product before seed can be sold to farmers or grain or other feeds can be imported for food and/or animal feed in their country. In the United States for example, depending on the product, three agencies may be involved in overseeing and approving GMO crops: the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 
The majority (1,458) of approvals on GMO crops have been on the food safety of the product. If you are interested in information on the regulatory approvals of GM traits, there are several online databases that provide this information including: 
3. The science and safety behind genetic modification and other advanced breeding techniques are well-established and strongly supported by the scientific community. 
In the 19 years since GMO crops were first commercialized (1996-2014), millions of farmers in nearly 30 countries worldwide have planted a total of more than 1.8 billion hectares (more than 4 billion acres) – with no evidence of harm to humans or animals. 
Since safety was first demonstrated and farmers began growing GMO crops, there has not been one substantiated instance of illness associated with GMO crops. Additionally, billions of animals have been fed diets that are predominantly made up of GMO crops, and there is no evidence of adverse effects on animal health or productivity. 
The science behind genetic modification and advanced breeding techniques is well-established and taught in primary schools, high schools and core curriculums at leading universities across the world. 
For thousands of years, farmers have altered the genetics of the crops we eat by selecting and replanting seeds from the plants that exhibited desirable traits, such as larger seeds or sweeter fruits. It wasn’t until the mid-1800s that Gregor Mendel and other researchers discovered and began to understand genetics – the science behind the art of plant breeding, which is taught in primary school science classes today. 
In the 1950s, the scientific community’s understanding of genetics continued to expand with James Watson’s and Francis Crick’s discovery of the double helix structure of DNA, which earned them the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1962. By the late 1970s, researchers – including Dr. Mary-Dell Chilton and Dr. Robb Fraley, who were awarded the 2013 World Food Prize for their contributions to agriculture – had gained the ability to isolate genes, and they discovered how to use recombinant DNA technology to transfer a gene for a desired trait into a plant.. 
By the 1980s, research in the life sciences and biotechnology was flourishing, and universities began implementing changes to improve instruction and expand research in biological science-based programs. This focus among universities led to a solid scientific understanding of the science and safety of genetic modification. It also led to further scientific discoveries in, and the use of, genomics, molecular markers and marker-assisted breeding in plant breeding programs worldwide. 
In addition, researchers at public and private institutions began testing GM crops, and they published hundreds of studies on the safety of biotechnology. If you are interested in learning more, we provide a list of peer-reviewed safety publications in the “Products: Product Safety” section of this website. Additional research also can be found through several online databases including:

Ask American consumers whether they support the use of biotechnology in food and agriculture and nearly 70 percent say they do. But ask the question another way, ''Do you approve of genetically engineered (or genetically modified) foods?'' and two-thirds say they do not. 
Yet there is no difference between them. The techniques involved and the products that result are identical. Rather, the words ''genetic'' and ''engineer'' seem to provoke alarm among millions of consumers. 
The situation recalls the introduction of the M.R.I. (for magnetic resonance imaging), which was originally called an N.M.R., for nuclear magnetic resonance. The word nuclear, which in this case referred only to the nucleus of cells, caused such public concern, it threatened to stymie the growth of this valuable medical tool. 
The idea of genetically modified foods, known as G.M. foods, is particularly frightening to those who know little about how foods are now produced and how modern genetic technology, if properly regulated, could result in significant improvements by reducing environmental hazards, improving the nutritional value of foods, enhancing agricultural productivity and fostering the survival worldwide of small farms and the rural landscape. 
Without G.M. foods, Dr. Alan McHughen, a biotechnologist at the University of Saskatchewan, told a recent conference on agricultural biotechnology at Cornell, the earth will not be able to feed the ever-growing billions of people who inhabit it. 
Still, there are good reasons for concern about a powerful technology that is currently imperfectly regulated and could, if inadequately tested or misapplied, bring on both nutritional and environmental havoc. To render a rational opinion on the subject and make reasoned choices in the marketplace, it is essential to understand what genetic engineering of foods and crops involves and its potential benefits and risks. 
Genetics in Agriculture 
People have been genetically modifying foods and crops for tens of thousands of years. The most commonly used method has involved crossing two parents with different desirable characteristics in an effort to produce offspring that express the best of both of them. That and another approach, inducing mutations, are time-consuming and hit-or-miss and can result in good and bad characteristics. 
Genetic engineering, on the other hand, involves the introduction into a plant or animal or micro-organism of a single gene or group of genes that are known quantities, genes that dictate the production of one or more desired elements, for example, the ability to resist the attack of insects, withstand herbicide treatments or produce foods with higher levels of essential nutrients. 
Since all organisms use the same genetic material (DNA), the power of the technique includes the ability to transfer genes between organisms that normally would never interbreed. 
Thus, an antifreeze gene from Arctic flounder has been introduced into strawberries to extend their growing season in northern climates. But contrary to what many people think, this does not make the strawberries ''fishy'' any more than the use of porcine insulin turned people into pigs. 
Dr. Steven Kresovich, a plant breeder at Cornell, said, ''Genes should be characterized by function, not origin. It's not a flounder gene but a cold tolerance gene that was introduced into strawberries.'' 
As Dr. McHughen points out in his new book, ''Pandora's Picnic Basket: The Potential and Hazards of Genetically Modified Foods'' (Oxford, $25), people share about 7,000 genes with a worm called C. elegans. The main difference between organisms lies in the total number of genes their cells contain, how the genes are arranged and which ones are turned on or off in different cells at different times. 
An insecticidal toxin from a bacterium called Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) has been genetically introduced into two major field crops, corn and cotton, resulting in increased productivity and decreased use of pesticides, which means less environmental contamination and greater profits for farmers. For example, by growing Bt cotton, farmers could reduce spraying for bollworm and budworm from seven times a season to none. Bt corn also contains much lower levels of fungal toxins, which are potentially carcinogenic.

The genetic introduction of herbicide tolerance into soybeans is saving farmers about $200 million a year by reducing the number of applications of herbicide needed to control weed growth, said Leonard Gianessi, a pesticide analyst at the National Center for Food and Agricultural Policy, a research organization in Washington. 
Genetically engineered pharmaceuticals are already widely used, with more than 150 products on the market. Since 1978, genetically modified bacteria have been producing human insulin, which is used by 3.3 million people with diabetes. 
Future food benefits are likely to accrue directly to the consumer. For example, genetic engineers have developed golden rice, a yellow rice rich in beta carotene (which the body converts to vitamin A) and iron. 
If farmers in developing countries accept this crop and if the millions of people who suffer from nutrient deficiencies will eat it, golden rice could prevent widespread anemia and blindness in half a million children a year and the deaths of one million to two million children who succumb each year to the consequences of vitamin A deficiency. 
Future possibilities include peanuts or shrimp lacking proteins that can cause life-threatening food allergies, fruits and vegetables with longer shelf lives, foods with fewer toxicants and antinutrients, meat and dairy products and oils with heart-healthier fats and foods that deliver vaccines. 
Real and Potential Risks 
G.M. foods and crops arrived without adequate mechanisms in place to regulate them. Three agencies are responsible for monitoring their safety for consumers, farmers and the environment: the Food and Drug Administration, the Department of Agriculture and the Environmental Protection Agency. But the drug agency says its law does not allow it to require premarket testing of G.M. foods unless they contain a new substance that is not ''generally recognized as safe.'' 
For most products, safety tests are done voluntarily by producers. The recent recall of taco shells containing G.M. corn that had not been approved for human consumption was done voluntarily by the producer. The agency is now formulating new guidelines to test G.M. products and to label foods as ''G.M.-free'' but says it lacks a legal basis to require labeling of G.M. foods. 
''In the current environment, such a label would be almost a kiss of death on a product,'' said Dr. Michael Jacobson, director of the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a nonprofit consumer group. ''But it may be that the public is simply not going to have confidence in transgenic ingredients if their presence is kept secret.'' 
The introduction of possible food allergens through genetic engineering is a major concern. If the most common sources of food allergens -- peanuts, shellfish, celery, nuts, milk or eggs -- had to pass through an approval process today, they would never make it to market. 
But consumers could be taken unaware if an otherwise safe food was genetically endowed with an allergen, as almost happened with an allergenic protein from Brazil nuts. Even if known allergenic proteins are avoided in G.M. foods, it is hard to predict allergenicity of new proteins. 
A potentially serious environmental risk involves the ''escape'' of G.M. genes from crops into the environment, where they may harm innocent organisms or contaminate crops that are meant to be G.M.-free. 
Dr. Jacobson concluded, ''Now is the time, while agricultural biotechnology is still young, for Congress and regulatory agencies to create the framework that will maximize the safe use of these products, bolster public confidence in them and allow all of humankind to benefit from their enormous potential.'' Two Congressional bills now under discussion can do much to assure safer use of agricultural biotechnology, he said. 
Correction: December 9, 2000 
The Personal Health column in Science Times on Tuesday about public anxiety over genetic modification of foods referred incorrectly to nuclear magnetic resonance, another technology that faced resistance fed by its name. That term -- later changed to magnetic resonance imaging, or M.R.I., when used in medicine -- referred to the nucleus of an atom, not the nucleus of a cell. 
We are keen to explore the potential of genetic technology, especially as a method of producing new medicines and improving seed. 
For example, the company has successfully used genetic engineering to develop drugs for the treatment of multiple sclerosis, hemophilia and certain eye diseases. Genetic engineering in the development of pharmaceutical products, or “red” genetic engineering as it is known, is widely accepted. 
However, “green” genetic engineering, i.e. genetic engineering in agriculture, is rejected by the majority of people and politicians in Europe, even though there is no scientific justification for doing so. Not one scientifically tenable study has ever indicated any risk to health posed by the use of genetic engineering in crop breeding per se. 
Genetic engineering offers farmers a number of concrete advantages already today. Genetically engineered seeds help them produce higher harvests from the same amount of resources. We primarily use genetic engineering to breed soy, cotton and rapeseed seeds. 
Safety is our top priority when it comes to the application of genetic engineering as well. We naturally comply with all applicable laws and regulations and the industry standards, and have also established our own additional internal rules. 
Manipulating the genetic makeup of living things is called genetic engineering, and scientists are learning more and more about this process each day. While there are some people who feel that tampering with the DNA of human beings or other organisms is meddling with Mother Nature, others see it as a sign of progress and an opportunity to make the world and the lives of humans and animals better. 
For more information on the history of genetic engineering, view the video below: 
Disease Prevention 
One of the top goals of genetic engineering is the improvement of health. Imagine a world without the threat of AIDS or cancer. Those working in the genetics field hope that manipulating the genes of humans will one day enable science to prevent people from contracting these potentially deadly diseases. Some diseases are more likely in certain people because they have a history of the disease in the family, meaning it could be passed down and make someone predisposed to a particular illness. Genetic engineering could theoretically eliminate the passing of “disease” genes. 
Pharmaceutical Development 
Genetic engineering can be used to improve the drugs available on the marketplace by making them more effective and safer. By using genetic modification scientists can make pharmaceuticals more effective than the existing versions of the medicine. There are already improved versions of insulin for diabetics and human growth hormones on the market thanks to genetic engineering. Manipulation of genes may also make it possible to create plants that contain natural medicines in labs. 
Agriculture 
Saving the seeds from the best looking plants to replant the following year has been a method of manual genetic selection for many years. But science has made it possible to engineer plants to produce the biggest and best fruits and vegetables possible by replacing the genes and designing plants with the most desirable traits. This leads to the availability of more and higher quality food that may also be resistant to the most common plant diseases. 
Transplants 
One of the most serious problems in medicine is the lack of available organs on the transplant list. While donating organs is a good way to help your fellow man, there are simply not enough to go around. Demand always exceeds the need, meaning many patients simply can’t survive until a match is found. But when those patients with failing organs knew in advance that they would need a new organ, doctors could simply order it and have a compatible heart, lung or other part “grown” in a lab. Genetic engineering may be able to make that a common occurrence eventually.

Genetic modification is one of the most controversial revolutionary developments in the biotechnological sector. Production, processing, marketing, and consumption of GM food and common advocation that they have benefits still manage to cause a huge conflict of opinions among the scientific, research groups, and the general public. 
However, many studies claim that with knowledge and education, the acceptance of biotechnology is increasing; the concerns of the public and consumers would seem to arise from a lack of knowledge and misunderstanding of biotechnology. When discussing GM food, it is important to understand not only the content and circumstances in which these developments take place, how they spread, and the production and processing of GMOs, but also the interests of different society groups and decision makers.

Development of Genetically Modified Food 
Biotechnology and genetic engineering was first developed in North America. Microbiologist Jonathan Beckwith was the first to successfully clone a eukaryote gene into bacteria Escherichia coli in 1974. First experiments with GM crops using herbicide-resistant tobacco trials were conducted in the EU and the US. 
In the USA, where two-thirds of all the experiments were made, scientists mainly experimented with GM crops tolerant to herbicides and less with crops that had the ability to change the quality of the product, for example, delay in maturation, better processing, increased solubility with solid particles, protein storage in seeds, etc. Over the years, experiments in this field increased mainly in the US and Canada. 
In Europe, the number of field experiments increased until 1999 but decreased after that time, as a result of the reluctant attitude of the European public towards genetically engineered food, something some biotechnological scientists have taken note of.

Economic production of GM crops began in China with GM tobacco and GM tomatoes that were resistant to viruses.  The USA soon became the main power of industrially produced GM foods. The American Food and Drug Administration issued the first permit for market production of GM in developed countries in 1994. The first on the market was a company called Calgene. It produced a tomato with delayed maturation; it carried a commercial name Flavr Savr. Two years later Monsanto bought Calgene. 
In 1996, the first year GM crops were available for commercial production, the US already had close to 7.5 million acres sowed with GM crops for reproduction of seeds and products such as Flavr Savr tomato, cotton with the BT-gene for resistance to herbicides and insects, soy with resistance to herbicides (approved also in Argentina), insect and herbicide resistant corn with the feature of male sterility, oil seed rape with changed quality of oil, insect resistant potato and pumpkin resistant to viruses. 
When commercial production started in the late 90’s and up to 2011, the production of genetically modified foods increased 94 times, and it spread to over 395 million acres of land, mainly in the US, Brazil, Argentina, India, and Canada. 
The most widespread genetically modified crops are soy (in 2011 it reached 185 million acres, which is almost half of all the agricultural fields – 47%), corn (126 million acres which represents 32% of all fields), cotton (61 million acres), and oil rapeseed (20 million acres). 
Even though some public organizations were included into research of modern biotechnology, the main developers are still multinational companies. Their products are inevitably oriented towards corporate profit increases; therefore common welfare effects may not be taken into account. 
Huge companies and private corporations in developed countries initially funded the costly research and development of GM crops. The reason for their relatively quick commercial availability lies in the huge amount of funding they provided and also in their interest in economic gains. 
As a result of  economic profit-seeking on the part of big agro-industrial corporations on one side, NGOs and civil society organizations taking a dim view on genetic engineering from the opposite side and coverage by the media of those conflicts, the public soon found itself caught between two powerful actors, each relaying a complex understanding of good and bad things that come with genetically modified food. 
If we put the bad information behind the wall for a moment, we may see potential benefits that GM food could bring to the world. 
One of the most important environmental benefits of growing GM crops is a resistance to bacteria, diseases, herbicides, pets, and insects. GM banana was modified in a way to resist the Black Sigatoka fungus that can destroy up to 70% of banana yields. Plants can be genetically modified to be tolerant to a specific weed killer. This allows farmers to control a wide range of weeds with less weed killer while not affecting the modified crop.

Moreover, GM crops have the potential to rehabilitate degraded land. Large areas of cropland in the developing world have become salinized due to unsustainable irrigation practices. Genetic modification could produce salt-tolerant varieties that would enable trees to grow in salt and drought. But while there is some advanced research in this area, salt and drought tolerance are the result of complex gene combinations, and positive results will take longer than those providing insecticide and herbicide resistance. 
Social Benefits 
Socially speaking, genetically modified food could potentially help to save the world from malnutrition and fight the global famine. One of the best solutions to fight vitamin A deficiency is golden rice, which has been modified to have enhanced levels of ß-carotene. The solution for cultivating golden rice entails inserting a gene that can survive in an environment with longer drought periods, producing sugar that protects the crop from dehydration allowing it to survive days without rain.

However, it cannot be claimed that the use of GM crops alone will eliminate the need for political, social, or economic change, or that they will simply ‘feed the world.’ 
There are many factors that contribute to poverty and hunger in developing countries, including war, political instability, lack of infrastructure, and poor economic conditions. But since agriculture has a crucial role to play in developing countries, especially as a source of employment, income and food for the poorest people, it is important to assess the potential contribution of GM crops. 
Economic Benefits 
Because GM crops require fewer pesticides, land, and water, they can reduce production cost and, therefore, the prices for consumers as well. The genetic modification of fruits and vegetables can make them less likely to spoil in storage or on the way to markets. This could expand trade opportunities, as well as reduce massive wastage incurred in transport and supply. 
Organic matter could also be bred to provide energy. Plant material fuel, or biomass, has enormous energy potential. For example, the waste from sugar cane or sorghum can provide energy, especially in rural areas. It may be possible to breed plants specifically for this purpose. And other unexpected, useful products could prove of huge value.

Medical Benefits 
Similar to long-established vaccines for humans, the use of molecular biology to develop vaccines and medicines for farm animals is proving quite successful and holds great promise for the future. Plants are being engineered to produce vaccines, proteins, and other pharmaceutical products. This process is called “pharming.” Although some are worried about the transfer of allergenic genes, genetic modification could be used to remove the allergen from products. 
Transparency and Knowledge is a Key to Acceptance 
Efforts are being made to try making biotechnology more open to the public. Increased transparency could lead to more insight into intellectual property surrounding these technologies—which would give us an opportunity to see the positive as well as negative aspects of this technology. 
Here scientists, government, media, and the public will have to upgrade their communication about this innovation. It is interesting to see that currently, there are two very distinguished views on genetic modification created by governments and media. Medical genetical modification is positively praised by public worldwide, while on the other hand agricultural use is negatively valued, problematic, and risky yet it is undoubtedly the object of economic development.

The truth is that a majority of people have to rely on governments, safety, and media exposure to develop an opinion about things. The same is happening to genetically modified food. However, as we have seen in the many examples above, re-questioning some of these views is very important. Maybe we shouldn’t have to worry about genetic modifications quite so much, but we do need to make sure the innovations will be used for their benefits and not for profit and economic greed.

Considering the way GMOs are viewed in Europe, this is a brave, balanced view that points to the benefits. And as you say, there is an odd conflict between the way medical genetic modification is viewed (good) and agricultural modification (bad). The main thing is to make sure that no damage is done to either the environment or human health – if necessary, adoption of GMOs can be delayed until it is proven that there is no danger. But proven benefits should not be foregone because of unfounded fears…

Roger Deal is trying to figure out how plants remember drought. 
An assistant professor of biochemistry and genetics at Emory University, Deal says most plants have a kind of memory for stress. When experiencing water shortage, for example, plants close the holes in their leaves, called stomata, to reduce water loss from their tissues. This in turn slows photosynthesis and plant growth. If the plants recover and go through a similar situation again, their cells somehow recall what that stress was like, so they’re able to bounce back more rapidly. 
Deal is focusing his attention on a close relative of alfalfa, Medicago truncatula, which seems to have a better memory than most. For some reason, Medicago is able to turn off its stress response much faster after drought eases — in a matter of hours versus days. As a result, it can recover more quickly and begin growing again as soon as better conditions arrive. 
Deal wants to know more because he figures if he can pinpoint the genetic material that controls this capacity, he might be able to find a way to switch it on in similar plants where it might be present but dormant. This would allow crops to get by with less water. 
Deal is not the only one with an eye to applying genetic engineering to helping crops thrive in tomorrow’s warmer climate. Around the world, researchers are working to create genetically modified crop varieties that can withstand severe drought, expected more often with climate change, or thrive on arid lands now considered unsuitable for farming. 
Engineered Resistance 
One crop genetically engineered for drought tolerance is already on the market in the United States: a corn variety called DroughtGard, created by Monsanto. Approved by the US Department of Agriculture in 2011, DroughtGard includes a protein from the bacterium Bacillus subtilis that Monsanto says will help the corn remain productive amid water shortages. DroughtGard has also been certified for sale in several other countries, including Australia, Canada, Mexico and Japan. 
The market response to DroughtGard has been slow so far: In 2014, about 500,000 acres in the US were planted with DroughtGard corn, representing about 0.5 percent of the nation’s corn crop. And results have been mixed. 
Another crop at the forefront of this new arena of GMO research is soybeans. In October, Argentina approved the use of a soybean genetically modified to withstand drought. Developed by Deborah Chan, a biochemist at the National University of Litoral in Santa Fe, Argentina, the new variety contains a gene from a naturally drought-resistant sunflower. 
It’s too early to know how the soybean will perform in real-world use. But if its developers’ claims that the modified soybean increases yields 14 percent under drought conditions and also withstands saline soils prove true, the potential impact could be enormous: Soybeans are the world’s fourth-largest crop by calories produced, the second-largest source of vegetable oil and the largest source of livestock protein feed. 
The Argentine firm Bioceres licensed the soybean and is in a joint venture with the US company Arcadia Biosciences, based in Davis, California, to market the new soybean. It has gone through field trials in the United States and Argentina, but has not been approved for sale in the US yet. The partners are negotiating to sell the seed in China, the world’s largest importer of soybeans. 
Peggy Lemaux, a cooperative extension specialist in biotechnology at the University of California, Berkeley, is lead researcher on another project aimed at engineering drought resistance into crops — in this case, sorghum. Her goal is to discover how epigenetics, the process by which environmental change triggers new genetic functions, could be altered to improve drought tolerance. If she and her colleagues can figure this out for sorghum, it could be applied to other species such as tomatoes and rice, also part of Lemaux’s research, through genetic engineering or by inducing mutations using radiation or chemicals. 
At the University of Cape Town in South Africa, researchers are studying Myrothamnus flabellifolius, a so-called “resurrection” plant that can bounce back from total water deprivation. Through genetic modification, they hope to bring this quality to teff, an important native African grain that is high in protein. Scientists at Technion–Israel Institute of Technology and the University of California, Davis, accomplished something similar with tobacco, while also extending its growing season. 
The modification has been adapted to rice, wheat, sugar beets and several other major crops. 
Desert Derivatives 
At Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee, staff scientist Xiaohan Yang is trying to discern the genetics behind a kind of photosynthesis that’s different from that used by most common crops. His subject? Agave, the hardy desert succulent that is the basis of tequila. 
Most plants use types of photosynthesis known as C3 or C4, in which they open their stomata during the day to take in carbon dioxide. Agave uses a different kind of photosynthesis, called crassulacean acid metabolism, or CAM. The plant opens its stomata at night to absorb carbon dioxide, when temperatures are cooler, then stores the carbon in a temporary pool of malic acid, thereby losing less water to transpiration. When the sun comes up, agave releases the stored carbon to complete photosynthesis without opening its stomata. 
As a result, CAM plants survive on as little as one-fifth as much water as C3 and C4 plants. 
Yang intends to map out the entire genetic pathway of CAM photosynthesis, then figure out a way to genetically empower C3 plants to adopt it. Ideally, he says, this modification won’t require adding any new genes at all, but merely giving existing genes in the plant a new assignment. 
“It’s ambitious, but we think it’s feasible in principle,” says Yang. “We’re not introducing a totally different thing, for example, to increase insect resistance. We’re just trying to change the opening and closing (of the stomata) to a different time period.” 
Yang makes this sound simple. But his proposal is like asking the human heart and lungs to operate at different times instead of simultaneously. To ease the complications, Yang recently published an article to describe additional research needs for other scientists. 
If Yang succeeds, millions of acres of desert now unsuitable for growing food could become productive farmland using crops that function like agave. 
“I’ve been talking about this with my colleagues, my friends and other scientists,” Yang says. “They feel excited about this, because it’s apparent the world is facing demanding challenges.” 
Familiar Concerns 
Many familiar concerns voiced about genetic engineering could equally apply to plants modified for drought resistance — for example, that their genetic alterations could cross with other species and upset ecosystems or that they could cause farmers to become more dependent on corporations for their seed stock. 
Doug Gurian-Sherman, a senior scientist at the Center for Food Safety, worries the focus on genetic engineering takes attention and funding away from other solutions — and their ancillary benefits. A recent article in the journal Nature, for example, reported that more than 150 corn hybrids produced by conventional crossbreeding methods to tolerate drought also increased crop yield as much as 30 percent. 
“Genetic engineering is being pushed at the expense of other approaches in agriculture that we know work,” Gurian-Sherman says. “That has a real cost.” 
On the other hand, if successful, the application of GMO technology to boosting drought resistance could be an important addition to the toolkit humans can use to adapt to climate change, which is expected to cause longer and more frequent droughts in many of the world’s important food-growing regions. 
“We don’t have to talk about future climate change,” Lemaux says. “We can talk about it right now. Being able to understand those [genetic] mechanisms and to build those mechanisms into other vegetable and crop plants, I think, is something we have to do.” 
Consumers will be able to decide for themselves in a decade or so, when these research efforts are expected to bear fruit.

Genetically modified crops offer ‘large and significant’ benefits in both developed and developing countries, according to a new meta-analysis. 
The study, published in PLoS One, concludes that despite the wide range of potential applications and potential advantages of genetic modification technologies, on average such crops are of significant agronomic and economic benefit. 
The team behind the work analysed data from 147 studies on genetically modified crops, finding that impacts and benefits vary by the type of modified crop trait and geographic region. 
“On ​average, GM technology adoption has reduced chemical pesticide use by 37%, increased crop yields by 22%, and increased farmer profits by 68%,”​ wrote the team, led by Matin Qaim from Georg-August-University of Goettingen in Germany. 
Through their analysis, the team showed that yield gains and pesticide reductions are larger for insect-resistant crops than for herbicide-tolerant crops, while yield and profit gains are higher in developing countries than in developed countries. 
Confusion and concern​ 
Despite the rapid adoption of genetically modified (GM) crops by farmers in many countries, public controversies about the risks and benefits continue. While numerous independent science academies and regulatory bodies have reviewed the evidence about risks and concluded that commercialised GM crops are safe for human consumption and the environment, many remain wary of genetically modified foods and crops. 
Some argue that the evidence about these environmental and agricultural impacts is mixed and that studies showing large benefits may have problems with the data and methods used, while some researchers and organisations firmly believe that genetic modifications can be a risk to human health. 
This uncertainty about the impacts and benefits of GM crops is one reason for the widespread public suspicion towards this technology, said Qaim and colelagues. 
“We have carried out a meta-analysis that may help to consolidate the evidence,”​ they added. 
Benefit analysis ​ 
The team carried analysed the agronomic and economic impacts of GM by collating information from 147 original studies that were built on primary data from farm surveys or field trials anywhere in the world. 
“Our meta-analysis concentrates on the most important GM crops, including herbicide-tolerant (HT) soybean, maize, and cotton, as well as insect-resistant (IR) maize and cotton,”​ noted the authors. “For these crops, a sufficiently large number of original impact studies have been published to estimate meaningful average effect sizes.”​ 
From these studies they worked out the average impacts of GM adoption on crop yield, pesticide quantity, pesticide cost, total production cost, and farmer profit. 
“Furthermore, we analyse several factors that may influence outcomes, such as geographic location, modified crop trait, and type of data and methods used in the original studies,”​ they reported. 
On average, Qaim and colleagues found that GM technology has increased crop yields by 21% - noting that such yield increases are generally not due to higher genetic yield potential, but to more effective pest control and therefore lower crop damage. 
“At the same time, GM crops have reduced pesticide quantity by 37% and pesticide cost by 39%,”​ they said. 
However, they noted that this effect on the cost of production is not significant, since GM seeds are more expensive than non-GM seeds. 
“But the additional seed costs are compensated through savings in chemical and mechanical pest control. Average profit gains for GM-adopting farmers are 69%.”​ 
They added that the effects on yield and farmer profit gains were found to be higher in developing countries than in developed countries. 
Another twist in the GM debate?​ 
The team suggested that affirming the evidence for the benefits of GM crops “may help to gradually increase public trust in this promising technology.”​

Like recent proposals for food labeling in various states, it almost like GMO proponents helped write some of these initiatives. They make actual implementation of GMO labeling so impratical it would be insanely stupid to make them law. It isn't nearly as compicated or difficult to enforce as politicians make it seem. This is all that it would take: (GMO plants have been banned in Europe and Japan, due to environmental and or health concerns. Do you feel conumers have a right to know if the food they eat has ingredients made from genetically modified plants? Yes or No). Producers that have No GMO will put that on the label, those that do not, don't have to reprint labels, since they are the majority. If there is any doubt that a Non-GMO claim is true, DNA testing is cheap and quick. It requires nothing else, the FDA is already at these facilities and can look at third party testing to verify food labels that claim to be Non-GMO. The consumer gets to choose, not force fed GMO foods without knowing. This approach is inexpensive, does not raise food prices or increase government payroll. Reports about the science and increase yield don't seem to report the extra herbicides and long term effect of cross pollination. They don't talk about the impact on the bee population or control of the food supply. They never address the injustice of lawsuits against farmers who lose thier property, right to grow what they want and ability to earn a living because of manipulation of the legal system. Let's have a few comments not related to science or the GMO agenda, but regarding moral issues and American liberty. If GMO foods are truly not dangerous to eat and are cheaper to grow, there are still plenty of unanswered concerns from many qualified to dispute the issues from all over the World. There remain issues of right and wrong that Americans should be aware of, and I never see those in the public forum or even grazed by articles like this one that make GMO appear a hero and disregard that thousands more tons of herbicides are being used. In Europe that is why they use the term Round Up ready in place of GM. The farmer can spray the whole field with a powerful chemical without killing the plant. The plant has a suicide gene so it cannot reproduce and neither can the farmer grow his own seeds. He must forever buy the seeds from the same supplier under the guise of protecting the ecosystem. Haven't the courts of the land already addressed that type of business decades ago?? I also wonder who sponsored this study, terms like unbiased, when so much is ignored is suspicious.

I honestly am not quite sure how to talk about “GMOs” in a way that will make everyone feel comfortable. I just know what’s right and true based on my values, my scientific education and experience, what I’ve learned about the wonderful people I know in Ag, and my passion for feeding people and taking care of the environment. 
I think the “GMO” conversation has become so heated from where I sit due to the immense emotional value that we place on food. It’s what many of us enjoy at the end of a hard day, it’s what we form memories around, and it’s what we use to provide for our loved ones so they can live healthy lives with full bellies and happy faces, though this is not the case in all places where food is more scarce. 
I think it’s amazing and honorable that people want to know more about where their food comes from. I think there are a lot of people in the agricultural industry that want to talk about what they do and why they do it. I also think that there is a lot of false information out there that is perpetuated. For example, here is a good resource that goes through some of the common misconceptions about “GMOs”. As a scientist, it just doesn’t sit right with me that false information is out there about something so important, like “GMOs”. 
Also, what’s up with the quotation marks I keep using around “GMOs”? “GMO” stands for “genetically modified organism” which means that the DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid), or genetic material, of an organism has been changed. This is a basic fundamental need of one of the central dogmas of continuing life on our earth: evolution. DNA needs to change and adapt to the surroundings through the generations, otherwise it will be outcompeted and made extinct. I understand why the debate is so confusing over GMOs because it’s a term that means something different to different people. How can we move forward in a constructive way if we’re not on the same page? 
Sarah Hovinga,Senior Scientist, Biologics Project and Product Support, Disease Management, Bayer Division Crop Science 
One of the modern techniques scientists use to introduce genes into crops to develop a new variety is by gene transfer using a bacteria called Agrobacterium. Basically, you give a gene that you want a plant to incorporate into its DNA to a bacterial strain. The bacterial strain enters the plant and the gene is transferred. A recent report goes into some more of the details about how this phenomenon of Agrobacterium transferring DNA into plants to modify their genes has actually been happening in a way in sweet potatoes for at least 8,000 years if you look at the genetic history of potatoes in countries like Perú. I believe one of the most fascinating aspects of science is discovering what wonders the natural world has already figured out. 
The Debate Over “GMOs” 
For me the discussion of GMOs is not about making a list of pros and cons; it’s about relating to one another and understanding each other’s interests and concerns. I could go on and on about how over 100 Nobel laureates are speaking to the safety of GMOs, or how GMOs have reduced pesticide use by over 1.2 billion pounds, but I don’t think that’s where to begin. Let’s start at the beginning and talk about what’s important to everyone: food, family, environment, and life. Let’s talk about the facts, constructively. Last but not least, if you’re like me and want to research, understand, and decide for yourself, there are a lot of good informational sites out there. Here are just a few of them and thank you for your time in reading what I have to say. 
www.bestfoodfacts.org: Hear directly from scientific experts about food facts. Go Science! 
www.findourcommonground.com: I really like the idea of this site since it promotes conversation between women buying and producing food. It brings the conversation to a relatable level from genuine people. 
http://genera.biofortified.org/wp/: Do you ever hear about all of those “peer-reviewed” articles in support of GMOs? How does one find these articles? It’s not very clear to a person outside the sciences, frankly. But here is a database that makes them easy to access. 
www.gmoanswers.com: Think of this like a search engine of asking questions about GMOS. Ask your question and see what answers pop up. These answers are from actual people. Try it out.

El tema da para muchos comentarios, pero entiendo que esto se viene suscitando porque todavía no hay comprensión clara a nivel de consumidores de los efectos ulteriores del consumo de los productos modificados genéticamente, muy a pesar que los venimos consumiendo por mas de dos décadas. La discusión no es de ahora sino desde que se descubre que la industria de agroquímicos no siempre es transparente con sus datos, especialmente por la guerra con las semillas "covachas" o artesanales que han sido el sustento por miles de años de la agricultura intensiva.

Sowing the seeds of the Second Green Revolution – BASF-Magazine Creating Chemistry 
The world’s population is set to reach 9 billion by 2050. Can our food system provide everyone with enough food for a healthy life, while maintaining a healthy environment? Professor Prabhu Pingali, Ph.D., director of the Tata-Cornell Agriculture and Nutrition Initiative, is cautiously optimistic but says sustainable intensification of agriculture and collaborative policymaking will be essential. 
Creating Chemistry: There’s widespread interest today in the sustainability and efficacy of the global food system. How does this level of attention compare to the early 1980s, when you were starting your career? Professor Prabhu Pingali, Ph.D.: When I started to work on agriculture and food in the early 1980s, almost all the emphasis was on staple grains – rice, wheat and maize – and the emphasis was very much on increasing overall production. There was very little understanding at that time of the overall food system and of the importance of building up a diversity of food available to consumers. That’s been the big change over the last three decades: moving away from this focus on staples to looking more broadly at the food system from farm to plate. 
In 2013, you became the founding director of the new Tata-Cornell Agriculture and Nutrition Initiative, which focuses on finding ‘agricultural pathways out of poverty and malnutrition in rural India’. Do you think the architects of the first Green Revolution would have expected such an initiative still to be necessary today? Yes, I’m sure they’d be surprised. The Green Revolution was focused very much on rice and wheat, and on self-sufficiency. By the early 1980s, India for example was food self-sufficient. But then you had this period between 1985 and 2005 that I call the lost decades for agriculture, when governments in India and more generally across the developing world stopped investment in agriculture because they thought they’d solved the problem. That’s part of the reason why we still have high levels of rural poverty.Also, government policy never got around to looking at the importance of a more diversified diet, so investments in vegetables and livestock lagged behind the main staples. You have this anomalous situation in a country like India where you’ve seen rapid economic growth but very high levels of malnutrition, especially among the poor. The institute was set up as a way to address this anomaly and figure out how to bring agriculture and nutrition back together again. 
“We’ve got the technologies, the land resources, and if government policies are focused on eliminating hunger and malnutrition, then we can see that change happen.” 
Professor Prabhu Pingali, director of the Tata-Cornell Agriculture and Nutrition Initiative 
By 2050, the global population is projected to increase by about one third, which the UN Food and Agricultural Organization has said requires a 70% increase in food production. How can we achieve this sustainably?I think we can do it and do it sustainably. For agriculture today in many developing countries, yield levels are significantly lower than their potential, and that gap needs to be filled. If the focus over the next two to three decades is on intensification in areas where agricultural production is currently taking place, we will see overall increases in productivity without having to expand land areas. And sustainable intensification is possible: One can look at various options for improving efficiency in fertilizers and water, for example. Intensification and sustainability work hand in hand. 
Assessing local vegetable value chains in an Eastern Indian village, February 2014. 
Meanwhile, there is also a huge problem of food waste. In developing countries, this occurs early in the supply chain, with crops lost before they can be eaten or sold. How do we address this? Much of the farm waste in developing countries takes place at harvest and post-harvest level. I think the way to solve these problems is for significant private sector investment to take place in these areas. This can be small-scale, with improved bags for storing grain, for example, to prevent insects from attacking the grain. One can also look at cold storage systems and at improved transport systems. But many of these need to be done in a way that’s focused on small farm ers. Governments can play a big role in promoting small-scale enterprises for post-harvest operations. 
Last year’s Nutrition for Growth summit in London delivered a commitment from rich countries to double spending on global nutrition from about $418 million to $900 million a year between now and 2020. How would you like to see that money used? I think this should be seen as an opportunity to focus sharply on the rural poor, on rural malnourishment and look at ways in which we can address that problem. Let’s focus on smallholder productivity growth, let’s look at the role of bio-fortified crops in addressing immediate nutrition needs for these populations. And let’s look at opportunities for diversifying their production systems. If we can bring all these together, along with complementary investments in water and sanitation, then I think we can make a big leap forward in improving nutrition security. 
Background: Genetic modification and genomics 
Genetic modification involves changing a plant’s DNA to equip it with characteristics that cannot be achieved through conventional breeding. Genomics is the study of all of an organism’s own genes, which control a plant’s inherent traits. This knowledge can be used, e.g, to breed novel varieties more efficiently. 
How significant are some of the recent advances in genomics and crop improvement, particularly in achieving bio-fortified varieties (such as vitamin-A enriched cassava) and improved tolerance to climate stress and water salinity?We’ve seen some remarkable new varieties because of genomic advances: drought-tolerant varieties and, of course, bio-fortified varieties. But the amount of material coming out of genomics in terms of finished varieties is still quite small. One of the main reasons for that is that public perception is quite neg ative about GM crops, and that perception carries over to genomics because public understanding of the difference between the two is not great. That’s a problem. The scientific community hasn’t been able to make the case that genomics per se is an important and independent innovation relative to GM crops. That perception needs to be addressed. 
Prabhu Pingali visiting a school lunch program in Bangalore, India, February 2014. 
How can we best ensure that these improved crop varieties are actually made accessible to those who could most benefit from them? In the early years of the Green Revolution, there were these networks of breeders set up around the world, and these networks were able to share genetic materials and improved varieties freely. Breeders were able to test improved material in their own environment and then have it released in their own countries. It was a major operation. By the 1990s many of these networks stopped working. Public support wasn’t there, and that’s been a big problem in being able to disseminate new modern materials. If there’s a way to come back to those types of breeding networks that can allow breeders to share material freely that would be a big step forward. 
Technologies such as SMS and GPS have become widely available, with even the poorest farmers having access to cell phones. How can such technologies be used to improve food security and nutritional outcomes?Certainly on price information, cell phones are filling a gap. Farmers are checking market prices and responding to that. That’s an easy win. The harder issue is the realtime crop management advice that can come from the use of smartphones. There are lots of experiments around that, such as farmers taking pictures of a disease on a plant and sending that picture to a lab and getting a response. The real challenge is scaling up. How do you turn these into commercial small enterprise operations that people benefit from? There are few places in smallholder agriculture where that’s happening, making small businesses of information services is the only way to sustain these operations. 
“Where I see real positive change happening is in the promotion of women’s self-help groups.” 
Professor Prabhu Pingali, director of the Tata-Cornell Agriculture and Nutrition Initiative 
Research by the World Bank tells us that putting food and income into the hands of women is the best way to improve public health, because women are more likely to invest in their children’s health and nutrition. How do we unlock the productive capacity of women farmers? Women farmers are crucial for ensuring overall agricultural productivity growth and food security. Where I see real positive change happening is in the promotion of women’s self-help groups. I see it in India and I’m also beginning to see it in other parts of the developing world. Women’s self-help groups came up initially as microfinance groups, but over time they have evolved to take on broader chal lenges around smallholder agricultural productivity, overall rural development, and rural governance. It’s that platform that I think we need to focus on. We need to fig ure out a way in which, rather than doing lip service about gender, we look at how rural women are transforming themselves and figure out a way to work with them and build on that platform for creating change. 
What was the Green Revolution? 
The term “Green Revolution” is used to describe the massive technological leap that occurred in agriculture from around 1960 to 1990, with largescale investment in agronomic research to combat widespread famine in developing countries. The introduction of cross-bred “high yield varieties” of rice and wheat, in particular, coupled with irrigation andindustrially produced fertilizers, delivered unprecedented growth in crop outputs. Many acknowledge the Green Revolution’s technical success but also point to serious draw backs, as a focus on yields over almost everything else led to some damaging environmental and public health impacts. Biodiversity and nutrition were also largely overlooked. In recent years, the term “Second Green Revolution” has been used to describe a new wave of more sustainable investment in agricultural growth. 
Agriculture can be a driver of growth, but many young people in developing countries are migrating to cities. How can we ensure that agriculture remains viable and attractive to younger generations?The draw of urban centers will continue. In my view, creating opportunities for rural entrepreneurs is probably the best way to go: rural entrepreneurs around the provision of agricultural services, information systems and post-harvest operations. If you can do that, then you create an opportunity for young people to earn enough to have a good life in rural areas. There’s very little government investment in making such rural enterprises grow and flourish. 
Do you think mankind will see an end to hunger and malnutrition within the next decades?It’s a question of can we, or will we? I think we definitely can. We’ve got the technologies, the land resources, and if government policies are focused on eliminating hunger and malnutrition, then we can see that change happen. Will we? I’m not as confident. You still have a strong urban bias to government policymaking, and there is little coherence between domestic policies and international policies. Unless you get the various policymaking groups to sit together and focus on a common goal of eliminating hunger and malnutrition, we’re not going to see it happen. But we have the means. We can make it happen.

More than 100 Nobel laureates have a message for Greenpeace: Quit the G.M.O.-bashing. 
Genetically modified organisms and foods are a safe way to meet the demands of a ballooning global population, the 109 laureates wrote in a letter posted online and officially unveiled at a news conference on Thursday in Washington, D.C. 
Opponents, they say, are standing in the way of getting nutritious food to those who need it. 
“Greenpeace has spearheaded opposition to Golden Rice, which has the potential to reduce or eliminate much of the death and disease caused by a vitamin A deficiency (VAD), which has the greatest impact on the poorest people in Africa and Southeast Asia,” the laureates wrote in the letter. 
Proponents of genetically modified foods such as Golden Rice, which contains genes from corn and a bacterium, argue that they are efficient vehicles for needed nutrients. Opponents fear that foods whose genes are manipulated in ways that do not naturally occur might contaminate existing crops. And, they say, the debate distracts from the only guaranteed solution to malnutrition: promoting diverse, healthy diets. 
“Corporations are overhyping ‘Golden’ rice to pave the way for global approval of other more profitable genetically engineered crops,” Wilhelmina Pelegrina, a campaigner with Greenpeace Southeast Asia, said in a statement. “This costly experiment has failed to produce results for the last 20 years and diverted attention from methods that already work.” 
Richard J. Roberts, one of two winners of the 1993 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, spearheaded the letter-writing effort to set the record straight. 
“There’s been a tremendous amount of misinformation being put out by Greenpeace,” he said. Some plant scientists have been “attacked so fiercely” over their views that they’ve gone silent, Dr. Roberts said. 
In the letter, the laureates — all but 10 of whom earned their prizes in the fields of physics, chemistry or medicine — contend that G.M.O.s have consistently been found to be safe. The Washington Post covered the group’s efforts on Wednesday. 
“Scientific and regulatory agencies around the world have repeatedly and consistently found crops and foods improved through biotechnology to be as safe as, if not safer than those derived from any other method of production,” the group of laureates wrote. “There has never been a single confirmed case of a negative health outcome for humans or animals from their consumption. Their environmental impacts have been shown repeatedly to be less damaging to the environment, and a boon to global biodiversity.” 
In a report released in May, the influential National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine found that genetically engineered crops appear to be generally safe to eat and safe for the environment. It resisted broad proclamations, however, calling such sweeping statements “problematic” because of a variety of factors that affect such an analysis. 
Consumers Union, a policy division of the nonprofit Consumer Reports, has approached the issue with caution, calling for labeling and federal scrutiny to better understand foods that contain genetically modified components. 
In 2014, the Pew Research Center found an enormous gap between the public and scientists on the issue. Just 37 percent of adults in the United States said genetically modified foods were safe to eat, while 88 percent of scientists connected to the American Association for the Advancement of Science said the same. 
Duck Younggren seems to be in the right line of business for someone with a sweet tooth. He grows sugar beets in northern Minnesota. He's been known to gnaw on a beet to get his sugar fix. 
“Core out a piece. Put it in your mouth,” he said. “It's like candy!” 
Younggren, who’s real first name is Dan, grows sugar beets in the Red River Valley, the largest area of sugar beet production in the U.S. About 60 percent of domestic sugar production comes from sugar beets-- a fact that has started to attract attention due to consumers' worries about GMO crops. 
Nearly a decade ago, Younggren and virtually all other sugar beet producers started growing crops that were genetically modified to resist the herbicide glyphosate, also known as Roundup. 
It was stronger than the old herbicides. And Roundup doesn't beat up the sugar beets, so their leaves grow a canopy faster, which prevents further weed growth and means fewer herbicide applications. 
“We are down to two passes over the field. It used to be five or six,” Younggren said. “We're saving fuel, we're saving trips over the field, wear and tear on our machinery, the fatigue of the person doing it. Not to mention the carbon footprint we used to have, is not there anymore.” 
The scientific consensus is that genetically modified foods are safe. But some consumers think more studies are needed. 
And some worry specifically about the effects of Roundup. Most regulatory bodies say it's safe, but there has been a lot of disagreement over the matter, even within parts of the World Health Organization. 
Weed resistance to glyphosate has also caused problems in parts of the country. 
Younggren said his genetically modified sugar beets are now getting a bad rap among consumers. 
“We were in a meeting and someone flashed an image up on the screen, and the picture said, 'Agriculture, meet your new boss,’” he said. “And the picture was a mother in a grocery store pushing her child in a cart. We have to convince the consumer that what we're doing is safe.” 
A few big food manufacturers, including Hershey's, are now moving away from beet sugar to cane sugar, which does not come from genetically modified plants. 
But there are limits to how dramatic a shift food companies can make. 
“They don't want to commit to doing something if they can't line up supply,” said Michael Swanson, the chief agricultural economist at Wells Fargo. 
Wells Fargo finances both sugar beet and sugar cane operations. 
Swanson said U.S. sugar policy puts some restrictions on how much sugar cane there is on the market, from both domestic and foreign sources. It's tricky to work around. What's more, sugar cane takes a few years to establish and really only flourishes in a few states. 
“We certainly can't get that much more sugar cane instantaneously,” Swanson said. 
Michael McConnell, an economist at the Department of Agriculture, said pricing and deliveries data give some indication that cane sugar is outpacing demand for beet sugar, possibly a sign of GMO fears affecting the market. Cane sugar's price is now 15 percent higher than beet sugar's on the spot market. And deliveries of cane sugar are up, whereas beet sugar deliveries are down. 
But McConnell said other forces have affected the market, too, like a change in sugar imports from Mexico. So the picture isn't totally clear. 
“There are a number of different factors and forces, both on the supply side and on the demand side,” he said. 
Tom Astrup, president of American Crystal Sugar, an agriculture co-op in the Red River Valley, emphasized the effect of supply issues on the market and denied the notion that GMO fears are hurting sales. But he acknowledged that the co-op is considering what for many would be the nuclear option: ditching genetically modified seeds. 
Astrup said it would be hard to ramp up the supply of seeds and chemicals for the sugar beet producers in the co-op to do so. 
“But at the end of the day consumers are going to decide whether they want food produced using GMO technology,” he said. “And if the consumer should decide on one path or another, we have to be prepared to provide the food product they desire.” 
For now, though, farmers in the co-op, including Duck Younggren, think that would be going backwards -- using more resources to grow their crops.

Our R&D program focuses on innovation to increase yields, quality, protect plants and improve resource efficiency in the field – by developing products and practices that reduce the land, water and energy needed to grow crops. 
We use our deep understanding of plants and specialist expertise in seeds, Seedcare and crop protection to develop solutions that enable farmers to grow more from less and work with them to tailor our products to better meet their needs; those solutions may be based on one technology – such as chemistry or genetics – or a combination of technologies. 
Growers face challenges in three key areas: 
Biotic stress from weeds, pests and diseases 
Abiotic stress (or environmental pressures) such as drought, reduced nutrients and irregular temperatures 
Meeting demands from customers and consumers for improved nutritional composition, consumer appeal, shelf life and processing ease 
Our research groups work together to combine technologies and develop integrated solutions that address farmer needs. The direction of new research is guided by our crop teams and based on customer need, technology, regulatory requirements and socio-political trends. R&D is at the heart of Syngenta's strategy and The Good Growth Plan. 
Our Crop Protection research focuses on developing a range of herbicides, fungicides, insecticides and crop enhancing chemicals with broad applicability such as foliar, soil and seed treatments. Our Seeds research and development program focuses on creating new varieties of major field crops, which include improved quality and productivity. This can include greater resistance to pests and diseases, or other environmental stresses, as well as characteristics such as improved customer appeal or enhanced shelf life. 
Crop Protection R&D is guided by customer need, technology and regulatory requirements, and provides Syngenta with innovative chemical and biological solutions. Aligning these new products with other technologies creates maximum value for our business. 
Over 2,000 people work in Crop Protection R&D. At our major Crop Protection research centers, researchers use state-of-the-art synthetic chemistry, high-speed automated synthesis and biological methods to prepare the quantity and quality of compounds required for targeted biological screening. We use a structured design approach to chemistry that helps us develop chemical entities that have the properties most likely to relate to the desired product profile. 
Once an active ingredient is ready for testing, we complete a series of trials to turn promising molecules into products that are safe to use, pass all registration requirements and meet customers' needs. The active ingredient's efficacy and safety is assessed as early as possible in the development process and all data are compiled for registration and safe product use. 
We then test compounds on target crops under different climatic conditions and in varying soils around the world to develop appropriate formulations and processes to manufacture the product on a commercial scale that meats the demands from our customers. 
On average, the registration of any new crop protection product takes eight to 10 years and costs around $260 million before a product is commercially launched. 
How does Syngenta conduct seeds R&D? 
Seeds R&D is dedicated to creating new varieties of major crops that offer improved quality and productivity, either alone or in combination with other technologies. This includes improving tolerance to pests and other environmental stresses, as well as enhancing quality characteristics such as nutritional composition, consumer appeal and shelf life. 
Over 3,000 employees work in our Seeds R&D to advance the performance, stability and quality of seed varieties covering over 50 food and feed crops, including our strategic crops. We have established, and continue to develop, one of the most extensive germplasm libraries in the world and we have R&D agreements and alliances with other companies and academic institutions to further extend the base of germplasm and traits we have to work from. 
We develop plants with desirable characteristics using both conventional breeding (to create either inbred lines or hybrids) and biotechnology. 
Conventional plant breeding involves crossing carefully chosen parent plants, then selecting the best plants from the resulting offspring to be grown on for further selection. Once the best lines have been selected, they are purified to create 'inbred' lines, in which every plant has the same characteristics, and the process of multiplying seeds begins. For many crop varieties, we produce hybrid seeds - the result of the first cross between selected parents: these seeds are unique in producing 'hybrid vigor', which leads to improved yield, performance stability and better quality. 
For certain crops, Syngenta also develops genetically modified (GM) plants where one or more genes of interest have been introduced to a plant via recombinant DNA technology instead of the plant acquiring them through conventional breeding. The process involved in the development of a new biotechnology trait is very complex. It takes around 13 years from the point of discovery of a new genetic sequence, which demonstrates changes in the plant metabolism or biological activity, through to the complex registration process required by regulators. All GM crops are thoroughly assessed for their safety to humans, animals and the environment before receiving final regulatory approval. 
Where does Syngenta conduct R&D? 
We employ over 5,000 people in our research and development centers and field stations around the world. Our main global research and development sites are in: Jealott's Hill, UK; Stein, Switzerland; Research Triangle Park and Greensboro, NC, USA; Goa, India; Beijing, China; Enkhuizen, Netherlands; and Saint-Sauveur, France. 
We have major Crop Protection research centers focused on identifying new active ingredients for crop protection products in Stein, Jealott's Hill and Goa. Our biotechnology activities primarily take place in Research Triangle Park for both the research and development of key native and genetically modified traits, and at the Beijing Innovation Center for early-stage evaluation of biotechnology traits. We also operate around 100 breeding and germplasm enhancement centers globally. 
Are environmental and health aspects taken into account throughout the R&D process? 
Environmental and health aspects are considered throughout our R&D processes. We undertake comprehensive assessments of both human and environmental risks throughout the research and development process. This covers risks associated with all stages of development – from concept right the way through to final use and consumption. Our human safety assessments address potential risks to users of the product and the consumers of food and feed, while our environmental safety programs seek assurance that the product will not adversely affect soil, water, air, flora or fauna. 
In order for a product to receive regulatory approval for registration we must first demonstrate that it is safe for workers, the environment, the crops being protected and the people or animals eating the food created from those crops. 
For crop protection products, about 30% of the cost of a new active ingredient is spent on product safety. Many of the compounds we discover are not progressed past the early development stages because they don't meet our stringent safety requirements. 
For genetically modified (GM) crops, rigorous laboratory and field studies are conducted to identify and assess potential toxic, allergenic or other unintended effects that may raise safety concerns. Agricultural biotechnology products are among the most stringently tested food products available on the market. 
Does Syngenta profit from or contribute to external R&D activities? 
We complement our in-house expertise through partnerships and collaborations to bring in novel technologies and exciting new offers to growers. We currently have over 500 R&D collaborations with universities, research institutes and commercial organizations around the world. These include collaborations with universities such as the ETH Zurich, Switzerland, Wageningen University, The Netherlands, Imperial College, UK, or Queensland University of Technology, Australia; or with research institutes such as the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) and private companies such as PlantLab, Metabolon, AgBiome and Bayer CropScience. 
Find out more about our collaborations on our website, on our thoughtseeders portal – our online platform that gives potential partners an easy way to share new technologies or ideas with us, as well as in our Sustainable Business Report (p. 12). 
Biotechnology 
What is biotechnology? What is a genetically modified (GM) organism? 
Biotechnology is the use of living organisms to develop products with enhanced features and includes the use of genetic modification, also known as "gene technology" or "genetic engineering". This refers to the process of adding a specific gene (or genes) to an organism or removing one to produce a desirable, and often novel, characteristic. In agriculture, it allows the production of food and feed crops with improved characteristics such as higher yield, improved nutritional qualities, or resistance against insects and diseases. Biofuels may also be produced from GM crops. 
Traditional farming practices have sought to combine crops that display useful characteristics to increase resistance to threats over an extended period of time. Since the start of crop cultivation thousands of years ago, farmers have looked for desirable traits to incorporate them into the following generation of plants. Originally they created new varieties by cross-breeding. This shuffled the plant's genes, leading to random variation, and the better plants were selected for replanting while the less interesting ones were discarded. By contrast, GM involves defining the desired characteristic in advance and then carefully selecting the gene that confers it. Developments in plant sciences have made it possible to identify desired 'traits' on a genetic level and to breed those desired traits safely and efficiently. 
Farmers need every tool available to them to increase production using limited natural resources to meet the growing demand for food, feed, fiber and fuel as the global population rises. Biotechnology can improve productivity, secure yields and improve quality of crops, while minimizing the environmental impact of their production. 
Biotechnology enables growers to achieve consistently high yields by making crops resistant to insect attacks or pathogens, or using herbicides so that weeds can be controlled more effectively. Genetically modified (GM) crops have enabled a 30% rise in corn yields in the US. The latest products are being developed to enable growers to respond to the effects of climate change such as drought and increasingly salty conditions. 
We believe the benefits of genetic modification and other biotechnologies should be available to growers to help them grow more from less. GM food, feed and fuel products continue to be the most heavily tested and regulated in agriculture. We support this approach as it demonstrates that GM products are just as safe as conventional varieties. 
Are GM crops safe for humans? 
Yes. All genetically modified (GM)crops are subject to stringent regulations and testing of allergenic or toxic properties for humans and animals. People around the world have safely consumed GM foods on a daily basis for over 30 years. Leading scientific bodies, regulatory agencies and international organizations have concluded that GM crops are as safe as similar crops developed using more conventional breeding methods. 
Do GM crops cause allergies? 
No. Food allergies are a concern for many people. Approximately 90% of food-related allergies are caused by proteins found in a range of common foods: tree nuts, peanuts, soybeans, milk, eggs, fish, crustaceans and wheat1. GM crops are always screened for potential allergens as part of the regulatory approval process. Also, biotechnology is now being used to modify or remove existing allergens from certain foods. 
1US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases; US Department of Health and Human Services; Food Allergy – an Overview; July 2007 
Are GM crops safe for the environment? 
Biotechnology delivers biodiversity benefits in numerous ways because of their proven record of environmental safety. By building in an ability to fight particular pests, insect-resistant genetically modified (GM) crops avoid the need for pesticides with minimal impacts on non-target species. Bt corn, for example, uses protein derived from the soil micro-organism Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt), also used as a pesticide in organic farming. Bt proteins target specific pests and degrade rapidly so they have a low impact on the broader environment.  There is no credible evidence that existing GM crops are or could be any more difficult to manage in the farm environment than conventionally-bred crops, for example, by becoming weeds. Both conventionally-bred and GM crops are developed to have certain traits that are beneficial for agricultural purposes.1 
1Crawley M J, Brown S L, Hails R S, Kohn D D and Rees M; "Biotechnology: Transgenic Crops in Natural Habitats"; Nature 409 (2001): 682-683 
Do GM crops increase the use of pesticides? 
Genetically modified (GM) crops do not increase the use of pesticides under good management practices. Some cases show the opposite: crops that can resist disease or pests do not require treatment. Cotton, for example, traditionally requires spraying to control pests inside the cotton ball, but the development of insect resistant GM cotton has greatly reduced the use of pesticides. 
Do GM crops compromise other types of food production? 
Good agricultural practices – that farmers have often been using for many years – help minimize mixing of crops and enable the various agricultural production systems to coexist in a particular country or region. These include separation of crops by space and time, communicating with neighbors, use of good husbandry, planting, harvest and storage practices. 
How much revenue does Syngenta generate from GM products? 
We sell genetically modified (GM) seeds for corn and soybean crops. 
The percentage of our total revenues generated from GM was just under 10% in the past 3 years, representing about 40% of our global seeds sales. Countries where our GM seed is cultivated include Argentina, Brazil, Canada, the Philippines, Vietnam and the US. 
What is Syngenta's position on labeling of GM products? 
We adhere to all local legislation regarding labeling of genetically modified (GM) products and we support the use of accurate and informative GM product labeling. All our seed bags are labeled to allow traceability throughout the supply chain, and we work closely with our suppliers and regulators to make sure that the information we provide is meaningful to the customer, enabling them to choose which products they want to use. 
We believe that consumers should be well informed about the types of foods available – providing choices about the food they buy. Labeling of GM produce enables this choice, but is not a safety issue, since GM products are subject to extensive safety assessments. Our view is that governments wishing to implement GM labeling in the interests of consumer choice must display the importance of providing consumer information with the associated costs and practicalities.

DetailsAbout the talk 
I am a plant geneticist. I study genes that make plants resistant to disease and tolerant of stress. In recent years, millions of people around the world have come to believe that there's something sinister about genetic modification. Today, I am going to provide a different perspective. 
First, let me introduce my husband, Raoul. He's an organic farmer. On his farm, he plants a variety of different crops. This is one of the many ecological farming practices he uses to keep his farm healthy. Imagine some of the reactions we get: "Really? An organic farmer and a plant geneticist? Can you agree on anything?" 
Well, we can, and it's not difficult, because we have the same goal. We want to help nourish the growing population without further destroying the environment. I believe this is the greatest challenge of our time. 
Now, genetic modification is not new; virtually everything we eat has been genetically modified in some manner. Let me give you a few examples. On the left is an image of the ancient ancestor of modern corn. You see a single roll of grain that's covered in a hard case. Unless you have a hammer, teosinte isn't good for making tortillas. Now, take a look at the ancient ancestor of banana. You can see the large seeds. And unappetizing brussel sprouts, and eggplant, so beautiful. 
Now, to create these varieties, breeders have used many different genetic techniques over the years. Some of them are quite creative, like mixing two different species together using a process called grafting to create this variety that's half tomato and half potato. Breeders have also used other types of genetic techniques, such as random mutagenesis, which induces uncharacterized mutations into the plants. The rice in the cereal that many of us fed our babies was developed using this approach. 
Now, today, breeders have even more options to choose from. Some of them are extraordinarily precise. 
I want to give you a couple examples from my own work. I work on rice, which is a staple food for more than half the world's people. Each year, 40 percent of the potential harvest is lost to pest and disease. For this reason, farmers plant rice varieties that carry genes for resistance. This approach has been used for nearly 100 years. Yet, when I started graduate school, no one knew what these genes were. It wasn't until the 1990s that scientists finally uncovered the genetic basis of resistance. In my laboratory, we isolated a gene for immunity to a very serious bacterial disease in Asia and Africa. We found we could engineer the gene into a conventional rice variety that's normally susceptible, and you can see the two leaves on the bottom here are highly resistant to infection. 
Now, the same month that my laboratory published our discovery on the rice immunity gene, my friend and colleague Dave Mackill stopped by my office. He said, "Seventy million rice farmers are having trouble growing rice." That's because their fields are flooded, and these rice farmers are living on less than two dollars a day. Although rice grows well in standing water, most rice varieties will die if they're submerged for more than three days. Flooding is expected to be increasingly problematic as the climate changes. He told me that his graduate student Kenong Xu and himself were studying an ancient variety of rice that had an amazing property. It could withstand two weeks of complete submergence. He asked if I would be willing to help them isolate this gene. I said yes — I was very excited, because I knew if we were successful, we could potentially help millions of farmers grow rice even when their fields were flooded. 
Kenong spent 10 years looking for this gene. Then one day, he said, "Come look at this experiment. You've got to see it." I went to the greenhouse and I saw that the conventional variety that was flooded for 18 days had died, but the rice variety that we had genetically engineered with a new gene we had discovered, called Sub1, was alive. Kenong and I were amazed and excited that a single gene could have this dramatic effect. But this is just a greenhouse experiment. Would this work in the field? 
Now, I'm going to show you a four-month time lapse video taken at the International Rice Research Institute. Breeders there developed a rice variety carrying the Sub1 gene using another genetic technique called precision breeding. On the left, you can see the Sub1 variety, and on the right is the conventional variety. Both varieties do very well at first, but then the field is flooded for 17 days. You can see the Sub1 variety does great. In fact, it produces three and a half times more grain than the conventional variety. I love this video because it shows the power of plant genetics to help farmers. Last year, with the help of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, three and a half million farmers grew Sub1 rice. 
(Applause) 
Thank you. 
Now, many people don't mind genetic modification when it comes to moving rice genes around, rice genes in rice plants, or even when it comes to mixing species together through grafting or random mutagenesis. But when it comes to taking genes from viruses and bacteria and putting them into plants, a lot of people say, "Yuck." Why would you do that? The reason is that sometimes it's the cheapest, safest, and most effective technology for enhancing food security and advancing sustainable agriculture. I'm going to give you three examples. 
First, take a look at papaya. It's delicious, right? But now, look at this papaya. This papaya is infected with papaya ringspot virus. In the 1950s, this virus nearly wiped out the entire production of papaya on the island of Oahu in Hawaii. Many people thought that the Hawaiian papaya was doomed, but then, a local Hawaiian, a plant pathologist named Dennis Gonsalves, decided to try to fight this disease using genetic engineering. He took a snippet of viral DNA and he inserted it into the papaya genome. This is kind of like a human getting a vaccination. Now, take a look at his field trial. You can see the genetically engineered papaya in the center. It's immune to infection. The conventional papaya around the outside is severely infected with the virus. Dennis' pioneering work is credited with rescuing the papaya industry. Today, 20 years later, there's still no other method to control this disease. There's no organic method. There's no conventional method. Eighty percent of Hawaiian papaya is genetically engineered. 
Now, some of you may still feel a little queasy about viral genes in your food, but consider this: The genetically engineered papaya carries just a trace amount of the virus. If you bite into an organic or conventional papaya that is infected with the virus, you will be chewing on tenfold more viral protein. 
Now, take a look at this pest feasting on an eggplant. The brown you see is frass, what comes out the back end of the insect. To control this serious pest, which can devastate the entire eggplant crop in Bangladesh, Bangladeshi farmers spray insecticides two to three times a week, sometimes twice a day, when pest pressure is high. But we know that some insecticides are very harmful to human health, especially when farmers and their families cannot afford proper protection, like these children. In less developed countries, it's estimated that 300,000 people die every year because of insecticide misuse and exposure. Cornell and Bangladeshi scientists decided to fight this disease using a genetic technique that builds on an organic farming approach. Organic farmers like my husband Raoul spray an insecticide called B.T., which is based on a bacteria. This pesticide is very specific to caterpillar pests, and in fact, it's nontoxic to humans, fish and birds. It's less toxic than table salt. But this approach does not work well in Bangladesh. That's because these insecticide sprays are difficult to find, they're expensive, and they don't prevent the insect from getting inside the plants. In the genetic approach, scientists cut the gene out of the bacteria and insert it directly into the eggplant genome. Will this work to reduce insecticide sprays in Bangladesh? Definitely. Last season, farmers reported they were able to reduce their insecticide use by a huge amount, almost down to zero. They're able to harvest and replant for the next season. 
Now, I've given you a couple examples of how genetic engineering can be used to fight pests and disease and to reduce the amount of insecticides. My final example is an example where genetic engineering can be used to reduce malnutrition. In less developed countries, 500,000 children go blind every year because of lack of Vitamin A. More than half will die. For this reason, scientists supported by the Rockefeller Foundation genetically engineered a golden rice to produce beta-carotene, which is the precursor of Vitamin A. This is the same pigment that we find in carrots. Researchers estimate that just one cup of golden rice per day will save the lives of thousands of children. But golden rice is virulently opposed by activists who are against genetic modification. Just last year, activists invaded and destroyed a field trial in the Philippines. When I heard about the destruction, I wondered if they knew that they were destroying much more than a scientific research project, that they were destroying medicines that children desperately needed to save their sight and their lives. 
Some of my friends and family still worry: How do you know genes in the food are safe to eat? I explained the genetic engineering, the process of moving genes between species, has been used for more than 40 years in wines, in medicine, in plants, in cheeses. In all that time, there hasn't been a single case of harm to human health or the environment. But I say, look, I'm not asking you to believe me. Science is not a belief system. My opinion doesn't matter. Let's look at the evidence. After 20 years of careful study and rigorous peer review by thousands of independent scientists, every major scientific organization in the world has concluded that the crops currently on the market are safe to eat and that the process of genetic engineering is no more risky than older methods of genetic modification. These are precisely the same organizations that most of us trust when it comes to other important scientific issues such as global climate change or the safety of vaccines. 
Raoul and I believe that, instead of worrying about the genes in our food, we must focus on how we can help children grow up healthy. We must ask if farmers in rural communities can thrive, and if everyone can afford the food. We must try to minimize environmental degradation. What scares me most about the loud arguments and misinformation about plant genetics is that the poorest people who most need the technology may be denied access because of the vague fears and prejudices of those who have enough to eat. 
We have a huge challenge in front of us. Let's celebrate scientific innovation and use it. It's our responsibility to do everything we can to help alleviate human suffering and safeguard the environment. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 
Thank you. 
Chris Anderson: Powerfully argued. The people who argue against GMOs, as I understand it, the core piece comes from two things. One, complexity and unintended consequence. Nature is this incredibly complex machine. If we put out these brand new genes that we've created, that haven't been challenged by years of evolution, and they started mixing up with the rest of what's going on, couldn't that trigger some kind of cataclysm or problem, especially when you add in the commercial incentive that some companies have to put them out there? The fear is that those incentives mean that the decision is not made on purely scientific grounds, and even if it was, that there would be unintended consequences. How do we know that there isn't a big risk of some unintended consequence? Often our tinkerings with nature do lead to big, unintended consequences and chain reactions. 
Pamela Ronald: Okay, so on the commercial aspects, one thing that's really important to understand is that, in the developed world, farmers in the United States, almost all farmers, whether they're organic or conventional, they buy seed produced by seed companies. So there's definitely a commercial interest to sell a lot of seed, but hopefully they're selling seed that the farmers want to buy. It's different in the less developed world. Farmers there cannot afford the seed. These seeds are not being sold. These seeds are being distributed freely through traditional kinds of certification groups, so it is very important in less developed countries that the seed be freely available. 
CA: Wouldn't some activists say that this is actually part of the conspiracy? This is the heroin strategy. You seed the stuff, and people have no choice but to be hooked on these seeds forever? 
PR: There are a lot of conspiracy theories for sure, but it doesn't work that way. For example, the seed that's being distributed, the flood-tolerant rice, this is distributed freely through Indian and Bangladeshi seed certification agencies, so there's no commercial interest at all. The golden rice was developed through support of the Rockefeller Foundation. Again, it's being freely distributed. There are no commercial profits in this situation. And now to address your other question about, well, mixing genes, aren't there some unintended consequences? Absolutely — every time we do something different, there's an unintended consequence, but one of the points I was trying to make is that we've been doing kind of crazy things to our plants, mutagenesis using radiation or chemical mutagenesis. This induces thousands of uncharacterized mutations, and this is even a higher risk of unintended consequence than many of the modern methods. And so it's really important not to use the term GMO because it's scientifically meaningless. I feel it's very important to talk about a specific crop and a specific product, and think about the needs of the consumer. 
CA: So part of what's happening here is that there's a mental model in a lot of people that nature is nature, and it's pure and pristine, and to tinker with it is Frankensteinian. It's making something that's pure dangerous in some way, and I think you're saying that that whole model just misunderstands how nature is. Nature is a much more chaotic interplay of genetic changes that have been happening all the time anyway. 
PR: That's absolutely true, and there's no such thing as pure food. I mean, you could not spray eggplant with insecticides or not genetically engineer it, but then you'd be stuck eating frass. So there's no purity there. 
CA: Pam Ronald, thank you. That was powerfully argued. PR: Thank you very much. I appreciate it. (Applause) 
While Greenpeace and other organizations oppose genetically engineered food, more than 100 Nobel laureates are taking a stand on the side of GMOs. Here's a look at each side's arguments. (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post) 
This post has been updated. 
More than 100 Nobel laureates have signed a letter urging Greenpeace to end its opposition to genetically modified organisms (GMOs). The letter asks Greenpeace to cease its efforts to block introduction of a genetically engineered strain of rice that supporters say could reduce Vitamin-A deficiencies causing blindness and death in children in the developing world. 
"We urge Greenpeace and its supporters to re-examine the experience of farmers and consumers worldwide with crops and foods improved through biotechnology, recognize the findings of authoritative scientific bodies and regulatory agencies, and abandon their campaign against 'GMOs' in general and Golden Rice in particular," the letter states. 
The letter campaign was organized by Richard Roberts, chief scientific officer of New England Biolabs and, with Phillip Sharp, the winner of the 1993 Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine for the discovery of genetic sequences known as introns. The campaign has a website, supportprecisionagriculture.org, that includes a running list of the signatories, and the group plans to hold a news conference Thursday morning at the National Press Club in Washington. 
“We’re scientists. We understand the logic of science. It's easy to see what Greenpeace is doing is damaging and is anti-science," Roberts told The Washington Post. “Greenpeace initially, and then some of their allies, deliberately went out of their way to scare people. It was a way for them to raise money for their cause." 
Roberts said he endorses many other activities of Greenpeace, and said he hopes the group, after reading the letter, would "admit that this is an issue that they got wrong and focus on the stuff that they do well." 
Greenpeace has not yet responded to requests for comment on the letter. [Update: Greenpeace responded early Thursday -- see statement below.]  It is hardly the only group that opposes GMOs, but it has a robust global presence, and the laureates in their letter contend that Greenpeace has led the effort to block Golden Rice. 
The list of signatories had risen to 107 names by Wednesday morning. Roberts said that, by his count, there are 296 living laureates. 
Nobel laureate Randy Schekman, a cell biologist at the University of California at Berkeley, told The Post, “I find it surprising that groups that are very supportive of science when it comes to global climate change, or even, for the most part, in the appreciation of the value of vaccination in preventing human disease, yet can be so dismissive of the general views of scientists when it comes to something as important as the world’s agricultural future.” 
The letter states: 
Scientific and regulatory agencies around the world have repeatedly and consistently found crops and foods improved through biotechnology to be as safe as, if not safer than those derived from any other method of production. There has never been a single confirmed case of a negative health outcome for humans or animals from their consumption. Their environmental impacts have been shown repeatedly to be less damaging to the environment, and a boon to global biodiversity. 
Greenpeace has spearheaded opposition to Golden Rice, which has the potential to reduce or eliminate much of the death and disease caused by a vitamin A deficiency (VAD), which has the greatest impact on the poorest people in Africa and Southeast Asia. 
The World Health Organization estimates that 250 million people, suffer from VAD, including 40 percent of the children under five in the developing world.  Based on UNICEF statistics, a total of one to two million preventable deaths occur annually as a result of VAD, because it compromises the immune system, putting babies and children at great risk.  VAD itself is the leading cause of childhood blindness globally affecting 250,000 - 500,000 children each year. Half die within 12 months of losing their eyesight. 
The scientific consensus is that that gene editing in a laboratory is not more hazardous than modifications through traditional breeding, and that engineered plants potentially have environmental or health benefits, such as cutting down on the need for pesticides. A report by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine, released in May, said there is no substantiated evidence that GMO crops have sickened people or harmed the environment, but also cautioned that such crops are relatively new and that it is premature to make broad generalizations, positive or negative, about their safety. 
Opponents of GMOs have said these crops may not be safe for human or animal consumption, have not been shown to improve crop yields, have led to excessive use of herbicides and can potentially spread engineered genes beyond the boundaries of farms. 
Greenpeace International's website states that the release of GMOs into the natural world is a form of "genetic pollution." The site states: 
Genetic engineering enables scientists to create plants, animals and micro-organisms by manipulating genes in a way that does not occur naturally. 
These genetically modified organisms (GMOs) can spread through nature and interbreed with natural organisms, thereby contaminating non 'GE' environments and future generations in an unforeseeable and uncontrollable way. 
Virtually all crops and livestock have been genetically engineered in the broadest sense; there are no wild cows, and the cornfields of the United States reflect many centuries of plant modification through traditional breeding. Genetically modified crops started to become common in the mid-1990s; today, most of the corn, soybeans and cotton in the country have been modified to be resistant to insects or tolerant of herbicide, according to government statistics. 
Opponents of GMOs have focused a great deal on the economic and social repercussions of the introduction of lab-modified crops. Greenpeace has warned of the corporate domination of the food supply, saying that small farmers will suffer. A Greenpeace spokesman Wednesday referred a reporter to a Greenpeace publication titled "Twenty Years of Failure: Why GM crops have failed to deliver on their promises." 
This debate between mainstream scientists and environmental activists isn't new, and there is little reason to suspect that the letter signed by the Nobel laureates will persuade GMO opponents to stand down. 
But Columbia University's Martin Chalfie, who shared the 2008 Nobel in chemistry for research on green fluorescent protein, said he thinks laureates can be influential on the GMO issue. 
"Is there something special about Nobel laureates? I’m not so sure we’re any more special than other scientists who have looked at the evidence involved, but we have considerably more visibility because of the prize. I think that this behooves us, that when we feel that science is not being listened to, that we speak out." 
Roberts said he has worked on previous campaigns that sought to leverage the influence of Nobel laureates. In 2012, for example, he organized a campaign to persuade Chinese authorities to release from house arrest the human rights activist and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Liu Xiaobo. Roberts said he decided to take on the GMO issue after hearing from scientific colleagues their research was being impeded by anti-GMO activism from Greenpeace and other organizations. He said he has no financial interest in GMO research. 
Update: Here is Greenpeace's response, datelined Manila, June 30, from Wilhelmina Pelegrina, Campaigner at Greenpeace Southeast Asia: 
“Accusations that anyone is blocking genetically engineered ‘Golden’ rice are false. ‘Golden’ rice has failed as a solution and isn’t currently available for sale, even after more than 20 years of research. As admitted by the International Rice Research Institute, it has not been proven to actually address Vitamin A Deficiency. So to be clear, we are talking about something that doesn’t even exist. 
“Corporations are overhyping ‘Golden’ Rice to pave the way for global approval of other more profitable genetically engineered crops. This costly experiment has failed to produce results for the last 20 years and diverted attention from methods that already work. Rather than invest in this overpriced public relations exercise, we need to address malnutrition through a more diverse diet, equitable access to food and eco-agriculture.” 
On alternative solutions: 
“The only guaranteed solution to fix malnutrition is a diverse healthy diet. Providing people with real food based on ecological agriculture not only addresses malnutrition, but is also a scaleable solution to adapt to climate change. We’ve documented communities across the Philippines that continue to express concerns about using GE golden rice as a solution. It is irresponsible to impose GE golden rice as a quick remedy to people on the front lines and who do not welcome it, particularly when there are safe and effective options already available. 
“Greenpeace Philippines is already working with NGO partners and farmers in the Philippines to boost climate resiliency (4). There’s a real chance here for governments and the philanthropic community to support these endeavours by investing in climate-resilient ecological agriculture and empowering farmers to access a balanced and nutritious diet, rather than pouring money down the drain for GE ‘Golden’ rice.” 
Humans have been genetically manipulating fruits and vegetables for thousands of years through selective cultivation. Once we started cultivating wild plants, fruits and vegetables got a lot more colorful. (Daron Taylor,Dani Johnson,Osman Malik/The Washington Post)

What Are the Benefits of GMO’s for Less Developed Countries in Critical Need of Food? 
What Are the Benefits of GMO’s for Less Developed Countries in Critical Need of Food? 
According to Janet Carpenter in Peer-reviewed surveys indicate positive impact of commercialized GM crops published in the journal Nature Biotechnology, yield increases across several genetically engineered crops and technologies were 4.8 times higher (6% versus 29%) in developing countries than developed countries. This is most likely due to less access to other technologies such as pesticides in developing countries. 
Growers in developing countries do not have access to proper safety equipment for pesticide applications. Genetically engineered products that reduce pesticide applications such as Bt cotton and Bt brinjal (eggplant) could have a much larger positive impact on human health in developing countries compared to developed countries. Kouser and Qiam reported that “Bt cotton now helps to avoid several million cases of pesticide poisoning in India every year, which also entails sizable health cost 1) Do you think that GMO’s pose a health threat to the general population? No, I do not think that GMO’s pose any more of a health risk than any other means of developing new crop varieties. The European Commission report A Decade of EU-Funded GMO Research came to this conclusion: “The main conclusion to be drawn from the efforts of more than 130 research projects, covering a period of more than 25 years of research, and involving more than 500 independent research groups, is that biotechnology, and in particular GMOs, are not per se more risky than e.g. conventional plant breeding technologies.” Links to similar conclusions on the safety of genetically engineered foods by major scientific organizations and societies can be found here. Many people in developing countries also suffer from vitamin or micro-nutrient deficiencies. There are several projects using genetic engineering to increase needed vitamin and/or micro-nutrient levels in crops. Golden rice has been developed to have increased levels of beta-caratene, the precursor needed for humans to make vitamin A. About 500,000 people, mostly children, go blind every year in developing countries due to vitamin A deficiency. About half of those die within a year due to complications associated with vitamin A deficiency. More information about Golden Rice can be found here.

What are the enviroment advantages of genetically modified foods and disadvantages of genetically modified foods? 
The feedback you provide will help us show you more relevant content in the future. 
It depends on the exact modifications made. There is no way to generalize for all of them. 
Pros 
A crop can be modified to require less water. 
A crop can be modified to produce its own pesticides so you don’t have to worry about a spray application entering the environment. 
Herbicide resistant crops can be planted closer together, allowing for more food to be grown in a smaller space. 
You could modify a crop to produce chemicals that attract natural predators of pests when they damage it. This would allow for less pesticide use.h 
Cons shared with conventional farming 
Monoculture. It’s good for maximizing yield and minimizing costs in the short term, but in the long term it drains the soil of nutrients and required more pesticides and fertilizers than a more diverse planting method would. Having more kinds of GM crops could actually help fix this by allowing the same type of crop (e.g. corn) to be grown for miles, but with enough diversity artificially added in to gain the same benefits of polyculture. Though I don’t know how long it will take to reach this point. 
GM crops that produce their own pesticides could harm beneficial organisms like bees. This problem is shared by conventional crops protected by systemic pesticides. However, right now the BT toxin used in GM crops only targets lepidoptera (butterflies and moths) and coleoptera (beetles). It is non-toxic to bees in the quantities to which they are naturally exposed. This is a potential issue with GM crops when poorly managed, not something that is actually happening now. 
Issues unique to GM crops 
They can cross-pollinate with native plants and their traits can leak into the environment. Really, this is the biggest issue with genetic modification. Of course, we could make them sterile, but apparently the public was worried that this would force farmers in poor nations to buy seeds every year instead of collecting from previous crops (of course they could just not use GM seeds to begin with but that would be reasonable), so we are stuck with fertile GM crops with the potential to escape into native populations. 
Roundup Ready crops are resistant to glyphosate which is a general herbicide that can be used for all weeds. Instead of switching between herbicides to minimize damage to their crop, farmers can save money by only using glyphosate for everything. Of course, this hastens pest resistance to herbicide and on the Roundup label it specifically tells them not to do this, but it takes effort and money to do things the “right way”. This is less a problem with the GMO and more a problem with farmers who cut corners to save money. 
Safety 
There are no safety concerns with GMOs at the moment. There are no credible studies that have found any difference whatsoever in the nutritional value or safety of conventional, organic, or genetically modified food. 
There are studies that claim that GMOs cause everything from cancer to intestinal inflammation to the death of gut bacteria. The issue is that these studies suffer from small samples sizes, contamination (e.g. the GM feed mixes into the control), not taking into account the fact that the rats being used are known to spontaneously grow tumors, having no idea how to diagnose gut inflammation to begin with, having zero actual evidence of gut bacteria being damaged, etc. There really isn’t any good evidence that GMOs are unsafe. 
It’s pretty sad, but apparently people just don’t feel like taking the time to actually read the science behind why glyphosate is a class 2A or “probable carcinogen” (just like being a fry-cook, barber, or working night shifts) or the studies that show GMOs and glyphosate causing cancer in rats (and drinking glyphosate increasing the life spans of male rats). 
Those who say that there need to be studies over a lifetime don’t really care about safety and just distrust large companies.. I’ve heard that they should be tested for 60–80 years before we know they are safe. In reality nothing is ever tested that long. It can costs hundreds of millions of dollars for less than 5 years of testing for a pesticide or GMO to get it to market. Who do you think is going to pay for decades of testing? Billions of dollars per GMO that at the end may not even be useful? 
It isn’t like the polio vaccine was tested for decades before it was deemed safe enough to use. It isn’t like the pest control methods used by organic farmers (e.g. new types of biological controls) are tested for decades before they are put into use. Antibiotics, cough medicine, perfume, makeup, preservatives, artificial flavoring, bug spray, shampoo, etc. Nothing we use that requires safety testing is ever tested for an entire lifetime before being put on the market. It simply isn’t necessary. Several years of rigorous testing according to standardized guidelines is enough and later tests are done if problems arise. The fact that there are people who expect so much out of GMO testing but not out of anything else we take for granted shows that it’s really just an excuse, not a real argument. There is plenty of research done before and after every GMO is produced. Would it hurt to have more? No, but remember government testing costs tax payer money. To reject it all because the tests didn’t last for decades is just unreasonable.

The main disadvantages of GMO foods are first, the use of glyphosate which is a probable carcinogin in their production, and secondly, in some people the GMO disrupts signalling so GMO corn for example is not recognized as food. Third. GMOs have taken over our food supply and they have not been tested adequately for adverse effects.

Climate change will make it increasingly difficult to feed the world. Biotech crops will have an essential role in ensuring that there’s enough to eat. 
Signs of late blight appear suddenly but predictably in Ireland as soon as the summer weather turns humid, spores of the funguslike plant pathogen wafting across the open green fields and landing on the wet leaves of the potato plants. This year it began to rain in early August. Within several weeks, late blight had attacked a small plot of potatoes in the corner of the neat grid of test plantings at the headquarters of Teagasc, Ireland’s agricultural agency, in Carlow. 
It’s now more than a month after the potato plants were first struck and still a few weeks before the crop will be harvested. A large country house, housing the operations of Teagasc, overlooks the field trials, and well-dressed Irish and EU bureaucrats hustle in and out. Much of the sprawling building was constructed in the 1800s, during the worst of the famines that were triggered when blight devastated Ireland’s potato harvest. Such famines are far in the past, but the plant disease remains a costly torment to the country’s farmers, requiring them to douse their crops frequently with fungicides. As part of an EU-wide project called Amiga to study the impact of genetically modified (GM) plants, Teagasc researcher Ewen Mullins is testing potatoes that are engineered to resist blight. (Watch a video of Mullins and GM potatoes in Ireland at the bottom of this page or here.) 
It’s breezy, and though the summer is over, it’s still warm and humid. “Perfect weather for blight,” says Mullins. Bending over the conventionally bred plants, he firmly pulls back the wilted stems and leaves to show that the tubers, half-exposed in the ground, are scarred with black blotches. Then he picks at a green leaf from one of the genetically engineered plants, which have been modified with a blight-resistant gene from a wild potato that grows in South America. The defenses of the potato plant have fought off the spores, rendering them harmless. The plant, says Mullins simply, “has performed well.” 
It’s the second year of what are scheduled to be three-year field trials. But even if the results from next year are similarly encouraging, Teagasc has no intention of giving farmers access to the plant, which was developed by researchers at Wageningen University in the Netherlands. Such genetically engineered crops remain controversial in Europe, and only two are approved for planting in the EU. Though Mullins and his colleagues are eager to learn how blight affects the GM potatoes and whether the plants will affect soil microbes, distributing the modified plant in Ireland is, at least for now, a nonstarter. 
Nevertheless, the fields of Carlow present a tantalizing picture of how genetically modified crops could help protect the world’s food supply. Blight-resistant potatoes would be one of the first major foods genetically engineered to incorporate defenses against plant diseases, which annually destroy some 15 percent of the world’s agricultural harvest. Despite the heavy use of fungicides, late blight and other plant diseases ruin an estimated fifth of the world’s potatoes, a food increasingly grown in China and India. Stem rust, a fungal disease of wheat, has spread through much of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula and is now threatening the vast growing regions of central and south Asia, which produce some 20 percent of the world’s wheat. Bananas, which are a primary source of food in countries such as Uganda, are often destroyed by wilt disease. In all these cases, genetic engineering has the potential to create varieties that are far better able to withstand the onslaught. 
GM potatoes could also lead to a new generation of biotech foods sold directly to consumers. Though transgenic corn, soybeans, and cotton—mostly engineered to resist insects and herbicides—have been widely planted since the late 1990s in the United States and in a smattering of other large agricultural countries, including Brazil and Canada, the corn and soybean crops go mainly into animal feed, biofuels, and cooking oils. No genetically modified varieties of rice, wheat, or potatoes are widely grown, because opposition to such foods has discouraged investment in developing them and because seed companies haven’t found ways to make the kind of money on those crops that they do from genetically modified corn and soybeans. 
With the global population expected to reach more than nine billion by 2050, however, the world might soon be hungry for such varieties. Although agricultural productivity has improved dramatically over the past 50 years, economists fear that these improvements have begun to wane at a time when food demand, driven by the larger number of people and the growing appetites of wealthier populations, is expected to rise between 70 and 100 percent by midcentury. In particular, the rapid increases in rice and wheat yields that helped feed the world for decades are showing signs of slowing down, and production of cereals will need to more than double by 2050 to keep up. If the trend continues, production might be insufficient to meet demand unless we start using significantly more land, fertilizer, and water. 
Climate change is likely to make the problem far worse, bringing higher temperatures and, in many regions, wetter conditions that spread infestations of disease and insects into new areas. Drought, damaging storms, and very hot days are already taking a toll on crop yields, and the frequency of these events is expected to increase sharply as the climate warms. For farmers, the effects of climate change can be simply put: the weather has become far more unpredictable, and extreme weather has become far more common. 
The central highlands of Mexico, for example, experienced their driest and wettest years on record back to back in 2011 and 2012, says Matthew Reynolds, a wheat physiologist at the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center in El Batán. Such variation is “worrisome and very bad for agriculture,” he says. “It’s extremely challenging to breed for it. If you have a relatively stable climate, you can breed crops with genetic characteristics that follow a certain profile of temperatures and rainfall. As soon as you get into a state of flux, it’s much more difficult to know what traits to target.” 
One advantage of using genetic engineering to help crops adapt to these sudden changes is that new varieties can be created quickly. Creating a potato variety through conventional breeding, for example, takes at least 15 years; producing a genetically modified one takes less than six months. Genetic modification also allows plant breeders to make more precise changes and draw from a far greater variety of genes, gleaned from the plants’ wild relatives or from different types of organisms. Plant scientists are careful to note that no magical gene can be inserted into a crop to make it drought tolerant or to increase its yield—even resistance to a disease typically requires multiple genetic changes. But many of them say genetic engineering is a versatile and essential technique. 
“It’s an overwhelmingly logical thing to do,” says Jonathan Jones, a scientist at the Sainsbury Laboratory in the U.K. and one of the world’s leading experts on plant diseases. The upcoming pressures on agricultural production, he says, “[are] real and will affect millions of people in poor countries.” He adds that it would be “perverse to spurn using genetic modification as a tool.” 
It’s a view that is widely shared by those responsible for developing tomorrow’s crop varieties. At the current level of agricultural production, there’s enough food to feed the world, says Eduardo Blumwald, a plant scientist at the University of California, Davis. But “when the population reaches nine billion?” he says. “No way, José.” 
Failed promises 
The promise that genetically modified crops could help feed the world is at least as old as the commercialization of the first transgenic seeds in the mid-1990s. The corporations that helped turn genetically engineered crops into a multibillion-dollar business, including the large chemical companies Monsanto, Bayer, and DuPont, promoted the technology as part of a life science revolution that would greatly increase food production. So far it’s turned out, for a number of reasons, to have been a somewhat empty promise. 
To be sure, bioengineered crops are a huge commercial success in some countries. The idea is simple but compelling: by inserting a foreign gene derived from, say, bacteria into corn, you can give the plant a trait it wouldn’t otherwise possess. Surveys estimate that more than 170 million hectares of such transgenic crops are grown worldwide. In the United States, the majority of corn, soybeans, and cotton planted have been engineered with a gene from the soil bacterium Bacillus thuringensis—Bt—to ward off insects or with another bacterial gene to withstand herbicides. Worldwide, 81 percent of the soybeans and 35 percent of the corn grown are biotech varieties. In India, Bt cotton was approved more than a decade ago and now represents 96 percent of the cotton grown in the country. 
Yet it’s not clear whether that boom in transgenic crops has led to increased food production or lower prices for consumers. Take corn, for example. In the United States, 76 percent of the crop is genetically modified to resist insects, and 85 percent can tolerate being sprayed with a weed killer. Such corn has, arguably, been a boon to farmers, reducing pesticide use and boosting yields. But little of U.S. corn production is used directly for human food; about 4 percent goes into high–fructose corn syrup and 1.8 percent to cereal and other foods. Genetically modified corn and soybeans are so profitable that U.S. farmers have begun substituting them for wheat: around 56 million acres of wheat were planted in 2012, down from 62 million in 2000. As supply fell, the price of a bushel of wheat rose to nearly $8 in 2012, from $2.50 in 2000. 
So far, the short list of transgenic crops used directly for food includes virus-resistant papaya grown in Hawaii, Bt sweet corn recently commercialized in the United States by Monsanto, and a few varieties of squash that resist plant viruses. That list could be about to grow, however. The Indonesian agricultural agency expects to approve a blight-resistant potato soon, and J. R. Simplot, an agricultural supplier based in Boise, Idaho, is hoping to commercialize its own version by 2017. Monsanto, which abandoned an attempt to develop GM wheat in 2004, bought a wheat-seed company in 2009 and is now trying again. And Cornell researchers are working with collaborators in India, Bangladesh, and the Philippines, countries where eggplant is a staple, to make an insect-resistant form of the vegetable available to farmers. 
These bioengineered versions of some of the world’s most important food crops could help fulfill initial hopes for genetically modified organisms, or GMOs. But they will also almost certainly heat up the debate over the technology. Opponents worry that inserting foreign genes into crops could make food dangerous or allergenic, though more than 15 years of experience with transgenic crops have revealed no health dangers, and neither have a series of scientific studies. More credibly, detractors suggest that the technology is a ploy by giant corporations, particularly Monsanto, to peddle more herbicides, dominate the agricultural supply chain, and leave farmers dependent on high-priced transgenic seeds. The most persuasive criticism, however, may simply be that existing transgenic crops have done little to guarantee the future of the world’s food supply in the face of climate change and a growing population. 
The first generation of insect-resistant and herbicide-tolerant crops offer few new traits, such as drought tolerance and disease resistance, that could help the plants adapt to changes in weather and disease patterns, acknowledges Margaret Smith, a professor of plant breeding and genetics at Cornell University. Nonetheless, she says there is no valid reason to dismiss the technology as plant scientists race to increase crop productivity. Scientists are “facing a daunting breeding challenge,” Smith says. “We will need a second generation of transgenic crops. It would be a mistake to rule out this tool because the first products didn’t address the big issues.” 
Developing crops that are better able to withstand climate change won’t be easy. It will require plant scientists to engineer complex traits involving multiple genes. Durable disease resistance typically requires a series of genetic changes and detailed knowledge of how pathogens attack the plant. Traits such as tolerance to drought and heat are even harder, since they can require basic changes to the plant’s physiology. 
Is genetic engineering up to the task? No one knows. But recent genomic breakthroughs are encouraging. Scientists have sequenced the genomes of crops such as rice, potatoes, bananas, and wheat. At the same time, advances in molecular biology mean that genes can be deleted, modified, and inserted with far greater precision. In particular, new genome engineering tools known as Talens and Crispr allow geneticists to “edit” plant DNA, changing chromosomes exactly where they want. 
Exact Edits 
The workshop adjacent to the rows of greenhouses at the edge of Cornell’s campus in Ithaca, New York, smells musty and damp from the crates of potatoes. It is less than a mile from the university’s molecular biology labs, but what you see are wooden conveyer belts, wire screens, and water hoses. Walter De Jong is sorting and sizing harvested potatoes as part of a multiyear effort to come up with yet a better variety for the region’s growers. Boxes are filled with potatoes—some small and round, others large and misshapen. Asked what traits are important to consumers, he smiles slyly and says, “Looks, looks, looks.” 
The question of how he feels about efforts to develop transgenic potatoes is not as easily answered. It’s not that De Jong is opposed to genetic engineering. As a potato breeder, he’s well versed in conventional methods of introducing new traits, but he also has a PhD in plant pathology and has done considerable research in molecular biology; he knows the opportunities that advanced genetics opens up. In the northeastern United States, a variety of potato is optimized for about a 500-mile radius, taking into account the length of the growing season and the type of weather in the area. Climate change means these growing zones are shifting, making crop breeding like solving a puzzle in which the pieces are moving around. The speed offered by genetic modification would help. But, De Jong says dismissively, “I don’t expect to use [transgenic] technology. I can’t afford it.” 
“It’s a curious situation,” he says. Scientists at public and academic research institutions have done much of the work to identify genes and understand how they can affect traits in plants. But the lengthy testing and regulatory processes for genetically modified crops, and the danger that consumers will reject them, mean that only “a handful of large companies” can afford the expense and risk of developing them, he says. 
But De Jong suddenly becomes animated when he’s asked about the newest genome engineering tools. “This is what I have been waiting my whole career for,” he says, throwing his hands up. “As long as I have been a potato scientist, I’ve wanted two things: a sequenced potato genome and the ability to modify the genome at will.” Across campus, De Jong also runs a molecular biology lab, where he has identified the DNA sequence responsible for red pigment in potato tubers. Soon, it could be possible to precisely alter that sequence in a potato cell that can then be grown into a plant: “If I had a white potato I wanted to turn red, I could just edit one or two nucleotides and get the color I want.” Plant breeding “is not the art of shuffling genes around,” De Jong explains. “Basically, all potatoes have the same genes; what they have is different versions of the genes—alleles. And alleles differ from one another in a few nucleotides. If I can edit the few nucleotides, why breed for [a trait]? It’s been the holy grail in plant genetics for a long time.” 
One problem with conventional genetic engineering techniques is that they add genes unpredictably. The desired gene is inserted into the targeted cell in a petri dish using either a plant bacterium or a “gene gun” that physically shoots a tiny particle covered with the DNA. Once the molecules are in the cell, the new gene is inserted into the chromosome randomly. (The transformed cell is grown in a tissue culture to become a plantlet and eventually a plant.) It’s impossible to control just where the gene gets added; sometimes it ends up in a spot where it can be expressed effectively, and sometimes it doesn’t. What if you could precisely target spots on the plant’s chromosome and add new genes exactly where you want them, “knock out” existing ones, or modify genes by switching a few specific nucleotides? The new tools allow scientists to do just that. 
Talens, one of the most promising of these genome engineering tools, was inspired by a mechanism used by a bacterium that infects plants. Plant pathologists identified the proteins that enable the bacterium to pinpoint the target plant DNA and found ways to engineer these proteins to recognize any desired sequence; then they fused these proteins with nucleases that cut DNA, creating a precise “editing” tool. A plant bacterium or gene gun is used to get the tool into the plant cell; once inside, the proteins zero in on a specific DNA sequence. The proteins deliver the nucleases to an exact spot on the chromosome, where they cleave the plant’s DNA. Repair of the broken chromosome allows new genes to be inserted or other types of modifications to be made. Crispr, an even newer version of the technology, uses RNA to zero in on the targeted genes. With both Talens and Crispr, molecular biologists can modify even a few nucleotides or insert and delete a gene exactly where they want on the chromosome, making the change far more predictable and effective. 
One implication of the new tools is that plants can be genetically modified without the addition of foreign genes. Though it’s too early to tell whether that will change the public debate over GMOs, regulatory agencies—at least in the United States—indicate that crops modified without foreign genes won’t have to be scrutinized as thoroughly as transgenic crops. That could greatly reduce the time and expense it takes to commercialize new varieties of genetically engineered foods. And it’s possible that critics of biotechnology could draw a similar distinction, tolerating genetically modified crops so long as they are not transgenic. 
Dan Voytas, director of the genome engineering center at the University of Minnesota and one of Talens’s inventors, says one of his main motivations is the need to feed another two billion people by the middle of the century. In one of his most ambitious efforts, centered at the International Rice Research Institute in Los Baños, the Philippines, he is collaborating with a worldwide network of researchers to rewrite the physiology of rice. Rice and wheat, like other grains, have what botanists call C3 photosynthesis, rather than the more complex C4 version that corn and sugarcane have. The C4 version of photosynthesis uses water and carbon dioxide far more efficiently. If the project is successful, both rice and wheat yields could be increased in regions that are becoming hotter and drier as a result of climate change. 
Rewriting the core workings of a plant is not a trivial task. But Voytas says Talens could be a valuable tool—both to identify the genetic pathways that might be tweaked and to make the many necessary genetic changes. 
The pressure to help feed the growing population at a time when climate change is making more land marginal for agriculture is “the burden that plant biologists bear,” Voytas says. But he’s optimistic. Over much of the last 50 years, he points out, crop productivity has made repeated gains, attributable first to the use of hybrid seeds, then to the new plant varieties introduced during the so-called Green Revolution, and “even to the first GM plants.” The introduction of the new genome engineering tools, he says, “will be another inflection point.” 
If he’s right, it might be just in time. 
Heat Wave 
For agronomists, plant breeders, and farmers, it’s all about yield—the amount a crop produces in a hectare. The remarkable increases in crop yields beginning in the middle of the 20th century are the main reason that we have enough food to go from feeding three billion people in 1960 to feeding seven billion in 2011 with only a slight increase in the amount of land under cultivation. Perhaps most famously, the Green Revolution spearheaded by the Iowa-born plant pathologist and geneticist Norman Borlaug substantially increased yields of wheat, corn, and rice in many parts of the world. It did so, in part, by introducing more productive crop varieties, starting in Mexico and then in Pakistan, India, and other countries. But for at least the past decade, increases in the yields of wheat and rice seem to have slowed. Yields of wheat, for example, are growing at roughly 1 percent annually; they need to increase nearly 2 percent annually to keep up with food demand over the long term. Agricultural experts warn that yields will have to improve for other crops as well if we are to feed a rapidly growing population—and yet rising temperatures and other effects of global climate change will make this tougher to achieve. 
David Lobell, a professor of environmental earth system science at Stanford University, has a calm demeanor that belies his bleak message about how global warming is already affecting crops. The effects of climate change on agriculture have been widely debated, but recently Lobell and his collaborators have clarified the projections by combing through historical records of weather and agricultural production. They found that from 1980 to 2008, climate change depressed yields of wheat and corn; yields still rose during that time, but overall production was 2 to 3 percent less than it would have been if not for global warming. This has held true across most of the regions where corn and wheat are grown. 
The finding is startling because it suggests that global warming has already had a significant impact on food production and will make an even bigger difference as climate change intensifies. “Anything that causes yield [growth] to flatten out is a concern,” says Lobell. And while overall yields of wheat and corn are still increasing, he says, “climate change becomes a concern long before you have negative yield trends.” 
Even more disturbing, Lobell and his collaborator Wolfram Schlenker, an economist at Columbia University, have found evidence that in the case of several important crops, the negative effect of global warming is more strongly tied to the number of extremely hot days than to the rise in average temperatures over a season. If that’s true, earlier research might have severely underestimated the impact of climate change by looking only at average temperatures. 
Schlenker’s calculations show steady increases in corn and soybean yields as the temperature rises from 10 °C into the 20s—but at around 29 °C for corn and 30 °C for soybeans, the crops are “hit hard” and yields drop dramatically. In subsequent work, Lobell showed that hot days were doing far more damage to wheat in northern India than previously thought. 
A surprising and troubling detail of the research, says Schlenker, is that crops and farmers don’t seem to have adapted to the increased frequency of hot days. “What surprised me most and should inform us going forward,” he says, “is that there has been tremendous progress in agricultural breeding—average yields have gone up more than threefold since the 1950s—but if you look at sensitivity to extreme heat, it seems to be just as bad as it was in the 1950s. We need to have crops that are better at dealing with hot climates.” During the heat wave that hit much of the United States in 2012, he says, yields of corn were down 20 percent, and “2012 is not that unusual a year compared to what the climate models predict will be a new normal pretty soon.” 
It’s possible that plants are simply hardwired to shut down at temperatures above 30 °C. Indeed, Schlenker says he’s not convinced that crops can be engineered to adapt to the increased frequency of hot days, though he hopes he’s wrong. Likewise, Lobell wants his work to better define which aspects of climate change are damaging crops and thus help target the needed genetic changes. But, like Schlenker, he is unsure whether genetics can provide much of an answer. 
In California’s Central Valley, one of the world’s most productive agricultural areas, UC Davis’s Blumwald acknowledges that scientists have “never bred for stresses” like drought and heat. But he aims to change that. Inserting a combination of genes for tolerance to heat, drought, and high soil salinity into rice and other plants, Blumwald is creating crops that have at least some advantages during extreme weather conditions, particularly during key times in their growth cycle. 
The challenge is to avoid reducing yields under good growing conditions. So Blumwald has identified a protein that activates the inserted genes only under adverse conditions. “There’s no cure for drought. If there’s no water, the plant dies. I’m not a magician,” he says. “We just want to delay the stress response as long as possible in order to maintain yields until the water comes.” 
Daily Bread 
A field just north of London on the grounds of Rothamsted Research, which bills itself as the world’s longest-running agricultural research station (founded in 1843), is one of the focal points of Europe’s continuing battle over genetically modified foods. The controversy here is over an 80-by-80-meter field of wheat, some of it genetically modified to produce a hormone that repels aphids, a common insect pest. In 2012, a protester climbed a low fence and scattered conventional wheat seeds among the GM plants in an attempt to sabotage the trial. The scientists at Rothamsted had the seeds vacuumed up, hired several extra security guards, and built a second fence, this one three meters high and topped with a curved overhang to keep it from being scaled. Later, a few hundred protesters marched arm in arm to the edge of the fenced-in field before they were stopped by the police. 
The fuss at Rothamsted is just one hint that the next great GMO controversy could involve transgenic wheat. After all, wheat is the world’s most widely planted crop, accounting for 21 percent of the calories consumed globally. Meddling with a grain that makes the daily bread for countless millions around the world would be particularly offensive to many opponents of genetically modified foods. What’s more, wheat is a commodity grain sold in world markets, so approval of GM wheat in a leading exporting country would likely have repercussions for food markets everywhere. 
Wheat is also emblematic of the struggles facing agriculture as it attempts to keep up with a growing population and a changing climate. Not only have the gains in yield begun to slow, but wheat is particularly sensitive to rising temperatures and is grown in many regions, such as Australia, that are prone to severe droughts. What’s more, wheat is vulnerable to one of the world’s most dreaded plant diseases: stem rust, which is threatening the fertile swath of Pakistan and northern India known as the Indo-Gangetic Plain. Conventional breeding techniques have made remarkable progress against these problems, producing varieties that are increasingly drought tolerant and disease resistant. But biotechnology offers advantages that shouldn’t be ignored. 
“Climate change doesn’t change [the challenge for plant breeders], but it makes it much more urgent,” says Walter Falcon, deputy director of the Center on Food Security and the Environment at Stanford. Falcon was one of the foot soldiers of the Green Revolution, working in the wheat-growing regions of Pakistan and in Mexico’s Yaqui Valley. But he says the remarkable increases in productivity achieved between 1970 and 1995 have largely “played out,” and he worries about whether the technology–intensive farming in those regions can be sustained. He says the Yaqui Valley remains highly productive—recent yields of seven tons of wheat per hectare “blow your mind”—but the heavy use of fertilizers and water is “pushing the limits” of current practices. Likewise, Falcon says he is worried about how climate change will affect agriculture in the Indo-Gangetic Plain, the home of nearly a billion people. 
Asked whether transgenic technology will solve any of these problems, he answers, “I’m not holding my breath,” citing both scientific reasons and opposition to GM crops. But he does expect advances in genetic technologies over the next decade to create wheat varieties that are better equipped to withstand pests, higher temperatures, and drought. 
It is quite possible that the first and most dramatic of the advances will come in adapting crops to the shifting patterns of disease. And as Teagasc’s Ewen Mullins puts it, “if you want to study plant diseases, you come to Ireland.” 
A hundred kilometers from the idyllic fields in Carlow, Fiona Doohan, a plant pathologist at University College Dublin, is developing wheat varieties that stand up to local diseases and trying to understand how plant pathogens might evolve with climate change. At the school’s agricultural experiment station, she uses growing chambers in which the concentration of carbon dioxide can be adjusted to mimic the higher levels expected in 2050. The experiments have yielded a nasty surprise. When wheat and the pathogens that commonly afflict it are put in the chamber with the increased levels of carbon dioxide, the plant remains resistant to the fungus. But when both are separately grown through several generations under 2050 conditions and then placed together, Doohan says, the plants “crash.” This suggests, ominously, that plant pathogens might be far better and faster than wheat at adapting to increased carbon dioxide. 
Next to the building is an apple orchard with representatives of trees grown all over Ireland, including heirloom varieties that have been planted for centuries. Doohan looks at them fondly as she walks past, the ground covered by fallen apples. At the far end of the orchard is a row of greenhouses, including a small one in which genetically modified plants are tested. Inside is a particularly promising transgenic wheat that is proving resistant to the types of scab disease common in Ireland. The new gene is also increasing the plant’s grain production, says Doohan, who created the variety with her colleagues. She’s clearly delighted by the results. But, she quickly adds, there are no plans to test the GM wheat out in the field in Ireland, or anywhere else in Europe. At least for now, the promising variety of wheat is doomed to stay in the greenhouse.

10 Questions About GM FoodsDo GMOs increase yields and reduce pesticide use, and are they needed to feed the world? Find out in the 16-page document, 10 Questions About GM Foods. 
“Let’s be clear. As of this year [2008], there are no commercialized GM crops that inherently increase yield. Similarly, there are no GM crops on the market that were engineered to resist drought, reduce fertilizer pollution or save soil. Not one.” – Dr Doug Gurian-Sherman, Genetic engineering — a crop of hyperbole. The San Diego Union Tribune, 18 June 2008. 
Claims of higher yields from GM crops pop up constantly in the media. It seems to be an example of a misleading claim that is repeated so often that people frequently fail to question it. Yet in the case of the most widely grown GM crop, GM soybeans, there has been evidence of consistently lower yields for over a decade. Controlled comparative field trials of GM/non-GM soya suggest that 50% of the drop in yield may be due to the genetic disruption caused by the GM transformation process. 
A US Department of Agriculture report confirms the questionable yield performance of GM crops, saying, "GE crops available for commercial use do not increase the yield potential of a variety. In fact, yield may even decrease.... Perhaps the biggest issue raised by these results is how to explain the rapid adoption of GE crops when farm financial impacts appear to be mixed or even negative." 
Monsanto released its second generation RR2 Yield GM soybeans in 2009, claiming that they would deliver higher yields. By June 2010, however, reports had emerged that yields were again disappointing and that the state of West Virginia had launched a probe into Monsanto for consumer fraud for false advertising claims. 
Conventional non-GM approaches, in contrast, have consistently been improving crop yields for decades and continue to do so. Such successes, in contrast with the often mythical claims for high-yielding GM crops, tend to go largely unsung. 
Here are a few examples of what non-GM approaches have been achieving. What would the GM lobby give for success stories like these? 
Beans 
High yielding, multi-disease resistant, non-GM bean success in Rwanda (February 2010) An excellent example of the success of traditional plant breeding practices - multi-disease resistant, very high yielding, and apparently freely distributed without Intellectual Property restrictions. 
Non-pesticide, non-GM cotton pest management success in India (June 2007) A relatively low-tech approach to managing pests promises to help hundreds of thousands of cotton farmers across Asia raise yields and reduce environmental contamination. 
Although drought-prone Zambia is still facing many problems, huge improvements have been reported in its maize harvests - its main staple crop. A report from Inter Press Service notes, "... production changed dramatically after President Levy Mwanawasa took over from Frederick Chiluba in 2001.... [He] promoted innovations like mixed farming and conservation farming. Mwanawasa rejected GM maize and encouraged the growing of non-GM maize, resulting in bumper harvests for the past three consecutive years." When the Zambian government rejected GM maize in 2002, there were calls from the US Ambassador to the FAO for its leaders to be tried "for the highest crimes against humanity in the highest courts of the world." 
"Super-rice" – bred for high yield, disease-resistance, etc. (January 2011) 
Soy 
High-yielding, soybean cyst nematodes-resistant non-GM soybeans (July 2007)  Soybean growers now have more options when selecting soybean varieties that have high yield potential and the ability to stave off soybean cyst nematodes - SCN, a tiny worm that infests the soil in many fields in Iowa and the rest of the Midwest of the United States and which steals soybean yields. 
US scientists develop high-yielding tomato (March 2010) New hybrid tomato plants are super producers capable of generating more and much sweeter fruit without genetic engineering. 
Wheat, potatoes, rice and other crops 
Hybrid crops without the GM (August 2013)British researchers are leading a global project to track down and store wild relatives of common crops - to help breed hybrids with higher yields that could be resistant to the effects of climate change.

A REPORT by the National Research Council last month gave ammunition to both sides in the debate over the cultivation of genetically engineered crops. More than 80 percent of the corn, soybeans and cotton grown in the United States is genetically engineered, and the report details the “long and impressive list of benefits” that has come from these crops, including improved soil quality, reduced erosion and reduced insecticide use. 
It also confirmed predictions that widespread cultivation of these crops would lead to the emergence of weeds resistant to a commonly used herbicide, glyphosate (marketed by Monsanto as Roundup). Predictably, both sides have done what they do best when it comes to genetically engineered crops: they’ve argued over the findings. 
Lost in the din is the potential role this technology could play in the poorest regions of the world — areas that will bear the brunt of climate change and the difficult growing conditions it will bring. Indeed, buried deep in the council’s report is an appeal to apply genetic engineering to a greater number of crops, and for a greater diversity of purposes. 
Appreciating this potential means recognizing that genetic engineering can be used not just to modify major commodity crops in the West, but also to improve a much wider range of crops that can be grown in difficult conditions throughout the world. 
Doing that also requires opponents to realize that by demonizing the technology, they’ve hindered applications of genetic engineering that could save lives and protect the environment. 
Scientists at nonprofit institutions have been working for more than two decades to genetically engineer seeds that could benefit farmers struggling with ever-pervasive dry spells and old and novel pests. Drought-tolerant cassava, insect-resistant cowpeas, fungus-resistant bananas, virus-resistant sweet potatoes and high-yielding pearl millet are just a few examples of genetically engineered foods that could improve the lives of the poor around the globe. 
For example, researchers in the public domain have been working to engineer sorghum crops that are resistant to both drought and an aggressively parasitic African weed, Striga. 
In a 1994 pilot project by the United States Agency for International Development, an experimental variety of engineered sorghum had a yield four times that of local varieties under adverse conditions. Sorghum, a native of the continent, is a staple throughout Africa, and improved sorghum seeds would be widely beneficial. 
As well as enhancing yields, engineered seeds can make crops more nutritious. A new variety of rice modified to produce high amounts of provitamin A, named Golden Rice, will soon be available in the Philippines and, if marketed, would almost assuredly save the lives of thousands of children suffering from vitamin A deficiency.

There’s also a sorghum breed that’s been genetically engineered to produce micronutrients like zinc, and a potato designed to contain greater amounts of protein. 
To appreciate the value of genetic engineering, one need only examine the story of papaya. In the early 1990s, Hawaii’s papaya industry was facing disaster because of the deadly papaya ringspot virus. Its single-handed savior was a breed engineered to be resistant to the virus. Without it, the state’s papaya industry would have collapsed. Today, 80 percent of Hawaiian papaya is genetically engineered, and there is still no conventional or organic method to control ringspot virus. 
The real significance of the papaya recovery is not that genetic engineering was the most appropriate technology delivered at the right time, but rather that the resistant papaya was introduced before the backlash against engineered crops intensified. 
Opponents of genetically engineered crops have spent much of the last decade stoking consumer distrust of this precise and safe technology, even though, as the research council’s previous reports noted, engineered crops have harmed neither human health nor the environment. 
In doing so, they have pushed up regulatory costs to the point where the technology is beyond the economic reach of small companies or foundations that might otherwise develop a wider range of healthier crops for the neediest farmers. European restrictions, for instance, make it virtually impossible for scientists at small laboratories there to carry out field tests of engineered seeds. 
As it now stands, opposition to genetic engineering has driven the technology further into the hands of a few seed companies that can afford it, further encouraging their monopolistic tendencies while leaving it out of reach for those that want to use it for crops with low (or no) profit margins. 
The stakes are too high for us not to make the best use of genetic engineering. If we fail to invest responsibly in agricultural research, if we continue to allow propaganda to trump science, then the potential for global agriculture to be productive, diverse and sustainable will go unfulfilled. And it’s not those of us here in the developed world who will suffer the direct consequences, but rather the poorest and most vulnerable.

GM foods may have beneficial qualities. (Image: Thinkstock Images/Stockbyte/Getty Images) 
Debate continues over genetically modified foods, with proponents claiming that crops derived from genetically modified organisms, or GMOs, offer benefits to farmers and consumers alike, while consumer watchdogs express safety concerns. Genetic modification gives foods qualities that help increase yield. The current most common GM crops primarily benefit farmers and agricultural companies, not the consumer. However, GM foods are coming through the pipeline that are geared toward consumer benefits. 
What They Are 
As the name suggests, GM foods are genetically modified, which means the DNA structure has been altered in some way. Biotechnology accomplishes this by removing genetic material from one organism and transferring it to the genome of another. It can be done in both plants and animals and enables biotech companies to patent the resultant food. The top three genetically modified crops in the United States are corn, soy and cotton, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. 
Product Quality 
Most GM foods are modified to benefit production such as increasing resistance to herbicides and pests. However, forthcoming GM foods are being tested to offer benefits to the consumer, such as enhanced product quality. For example, biotech companies have received approval to test GM fruits and vegetables that have improved flavor and texture, as well as delayed ripening. This means produce will stay fresh for longer periods of time. 
Nutritional Benefits 
GM foods are being developed to have enhanced nutritional content to benefit your health. In development are foods that have genes modified to produce a higher protein content. Other development focuses on enhancing the fatty acid profile so that crops produce higher levels of polyunsaturated fats, which play a role in protecting against heart disease. Biotech companies are also developing crops that have higher vitamins and minerals, as well as enhanced antioxidant content, which may help prevent chronic diseases. 
Other Benefits 
Another area of benefit biotech companies are working on is decreasing potentially harmful chemicals and addressing allergens. For example, biotech companies have received approval to develop gluten-free wheat. Gluten is a protein found in wheat, rye and barley that some people are unable to eat due to an autoimmune reaction. In addition, the U.S. Food and Drug administration cleared the way for GM potatoes to hit the market that have been modified to produce lower levels of a cancer-causing chemical called acrylamide.

GM crop impact: 1996-2014

Foreword
This paper is intended for use by a wide range of people with interests in agriculture across the
world – farmers, farmer organisations, industry associations, inter-professional bodies, input
suppliers, users of agricultural products, government departments, international organisations,
non governmental organisations, politicians, academics, researchers, students and interested
citizens.
The material contained in the paper, which is the eleventh annual report on the global economic
and environmental impact of genetically modified (GM) crops, aims to provide insights into the
reasons why so many farmers around the world have adopted crop biotechnology and continue
to use it in their production systems since the technology first became available on a widespread
commercial basis in the mid 1990s.
The paper draws, and is largely based on, the considerable body of consistent peer reviewed
literature available that has examined the economic and other reasons behind farm level crop
biotechnology adoption, together with the environmental impacts associated with the changes 1.
0F

Given the controversy that the use of this technology engenders in some debates and for some
people, the work contained in this paper has been submitted and accepted for publication in a
peer reviewed publication. The length of this paper, at nearly 200 pages, is too long for
acceptance for publication as a single document in peer reviewed journals. Therefore, the authors
submitted two papers focusing separately on the economic and environmental impacts of the
technology. These papers have been accepted for publication in the peer reviewed journal, GM
crops (www.tandfonline.com/loi/kgmc20). The economic impact paper (Global income and
production effects of GM crops 1996-2014) will be available in GM Crops and Food:
Biotechnology in Agriculture and the Food Chain, volume 7, issue 1 and the environmental
impact paper (Key environmental impacts of global GM crop use 1996-2014) will be available in
the edition, volume 7, issue 2. These papers follow on from 20 previous peer reviewed papers by
the authors on the subject of crop biotechnology impact 2.

GM crop impact: 1996-2014

Executive summary and conclusions
This study presents the findings of research into the global socio-economic and environmental
impact of genetically modified (GM) crops in the nineteen years since they were first
commercially planted on a significant area. It focuses on the farm level economic effects, the
production effects, the environmental impact resulting from changes in the use of insecticides
and herbicides, and the contribution towards reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.
Farm income effects 3
GM technology has had a significant positive impact on farm income derived from a combination
of enhanced productivity and efficiency gains (Table 1). In 2014, the direct global farm income
benefit from GM crops was $17.7 billion. This is equivalent to having added 7.2% to the value of
global production of the four main crops of soybeans, maize, canola and cotton. Since 1996, farm
incomes have increased by $150.3 billion.
2F

The largest gains in farm income in 2014 have arisen in the maize sector, largely from yield gains.
The $5.3 billion additional income generated by GM insect resistant (GM IR) maize in 2014 has
been equivalent to adding 6.1% to the value of the crop in the GM crop growing countries, or
adding the equivalent of 3.2% to the $163 billion value of the global maize crop in 2014.
Cumulatively since 1996, GM IR technology has added $41.4 billion to the income of global maize
farmers.
Substantial gains have also arisen in the cotton sector through a combination of higher yields and
lower costs. In 2014, cotton farm income levels in the GM adopting countries increased by $3.94
billion and since 1996, the sector has benefited from an additional $44.8 billion. The 2014 income
gains are equivalent to adding 12.5% to the value of the cotton crop in these countries, or 8.9% to
the $44 billion value of total global cotton production. This is a substantial increase in value
added terms for two new cotton seed technologies.
Significant increases to farm incomes have also resulted in the soybean and canola sectors. The
GM HT technology in soybeans has boosted farm incomes by $5.2 billion in 2014, and since 1996
has delivered $46.6 billion of extra farm income. The second year of adoption of ‘Intacta’
soybeans (combining HT and IR traits) in South America also provided $0.85 billion of additional
farm income and over the two years of 2013 and 2014 has delivered nearly $1.2 billion of
additional farm income. In the canola sector (largely North American) an additional $4.86 billion
has been generated (1996-2014).
Table 2 summarises farm income impacts in key GM crop adopting countries. This highlights the
important farm income benefit arising from GM HT soybeans in South America (Argentina,
Bolivia, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay), GM IR cotton in China and India and a range of GM
cultivars in the US. It also illustrates the growing level of farm income benefits being obtained in
South Africa, the Philippines, Mexico and Colombia.
In terms of the division of the economic benefits obtained by farmers in developing countries
relative to farmers in developed countries, Table 3 shows that in 2014, 46% of the farm income
3

GM crop impact: 1996-2014

benefits have been earned by developing country farmers. The vast majority of these income
gains for developing country farmers have been from GM IR cotton and GM HT soybeans 4. Over
the nineteen years, 1996-2014, the cumulative farm income gain derived by developing country
farmers was 50.6% ($76.06 billion).
3F

Examining the cost farmers pay for accessing GM technology, Table 4 shows that across the four
main GM crops, the total cost in 2014 was equal to 28% of the total technology gains (inclusive of
farm income gains plus cost of the technology payable to the seed supply chain 5).
4F

For farmers in developing countries the total cost was equal to 23% of total technology gains,
whilst for farmers in developed countries the cost was 32% of the total technology gains. Whilst
circumstances vary between countries, the higher share of total technology gains accounted for
by farm income gains in developing countries, relative to the farm income share in developed
countries, reflects factors such as weaker provision and enforcement of intellectual property
rights in developing countries and the higher average level of farm income gain on a per hectare
basis derived by developing country farmers relative to developed country farmers.

Production effects of the technology
Based on the yield impacts used in the direct farm income benefit calculations (see appendix 2)
and taking account of the second soybean crop facilitation in South America, GM crops have
added important volumes to global production of corn, cotton, canola and soybeans since 1996
(Table 5).
The GM IR traits, used in maize and cotton, have accounted for 95.3% of the additional maize
production and 99.3% of the additional cotton production. Positive yield impacts from the use of
this technology have occurred in all user countries (except for GM IR cotton in Australia where
the levels of Heliothis sp (boll and bud worm pests) pest control previously obtained with
intensive insecticide use were very good). The main benefit and reason for adoption of this
technology in Australia has arisen from significant cost savings and the associated environmental
gains from reduced insecticide use, when compared to average yields derived from crops using
conventional technology (such as application of insecticides and seed treatments). The average
yield impact across the total area planted to these traits over the 19 years since 1996 has been
+11.7% for maize and +17% for cotton.

GM crop impact: 1996-2014

The primary impacts of GM HT technology have been to provide more cost effective (less
expensive) and easier weed control. In some countries, the improved weed control has led to
higher yields, though the main source of additional production has been via the facilitation of no
tillage production systems and how this has shortened the production cycle and enabled many
farmers in South America to plant a crop of soybeans immediately after a wheat crop in the same
growing season. This second crop, additional to traditional soybean production, has added 135.7
million tonnes to soybean production in Argentina and Paraguay between 1996 and 2014
(accounting for 85.7% of the total GM HT-related additional soybean production). Intacta (IR)
soybeans have also added a further 2.56 million tonnes to global soybean production.

Environmental impact from changes in insecticide and herbicide use 6
To examine this impact, the study has analysed both active ingredient use and utilised the
indicator known as the Environmental Impact Quotient (EIQ) to assess the broader impact on the
environment (plus impact on animal and human health). The EIQ distils the various
environmental and health impacts of individual pesticides in different GM and conventional
production systems into a single ‘field value per hectare’ and draws on key toxicity and
environmental exposure data related to individual products. It therefore provides a better
measure to contrast and compare the impact of various pesticides on the environment and
human health than weight of active ingredient alone. Readers should, however, note that the EIQ
is an indicator only (primarily of toxicity) and does not take into account all environmental issues
and impacts. In the analysis of GM HT production, we have assumed that the conventional
alternative delivers the same level of weed control as occurs in the GM HT production system.
5F

GM traits have contributed to a significant reduction in the environmental impact associated with
insecticide and herbicide use on the areas devoted to GM crops (Table 6). Since 1996, the use of
pesticides on the GM crop area was reduced by 581.4 million kg of active ingredient (8.2%
reduction), and the environmental impact associated with herbicide and insecticide use on these
crops, as measured by the EIQ indicator, fell by18.5%.
In absolute terms, the largest environmental gain has been associated with the adoption of GM
insect resistant (IR) technology. GM IR cotton has contributed a 43% reduction in the total
volume of active ingredient used on GM crops (-249.1 million kg active ingredient, equivalent to
a 27.9% reduction in insecticide use on the GM IR cotton area) and a 36% reduction in the total
field EIQ indicator measure associated with GM crop use (1996-2014) due to the significant
reduction in insecticide use that the technology has facilitated, in what has traditionally been an
intensive user of insecticides. Similarly, the use of GM IR technology in maize has led to
6

13

GM crop impact: 1996-2014

important reductions in insecticide use (79.7 million kg of active ingredient), with associated
environmental benefits.
The volume of herbicides used in GM maize crops also decreased by 213.7 million kg (1996-2014),
an 8.4% reduction, whilst the overall environmental impact associated with herbicide use on
these crops decreased by a significantly larger 12.6%. This highlights the switch in herbicides
used with most GM herbicide tolerant (HT) crops to active ingredients with a more
environmentally benign profile than the ones generally used on conventional crops.
Important environmental gains have also arisen in the soybean and canola sectors. In the
soybean sector, whilst herbicide use increased by 5.5 million kg (1996-2014), the associated
environmental impact of herbicide use on this crop area decreased (improved) by 14.1%, due to a
switch to more environmentally benign herbicides. In the canola sector, farmers reduced
herbicide use by 21.8 million kg (a 17.2% reduction) and the associated environmental impact of
herbicide use on this crop area fell by 29.3% (due to a switch to more environmentally benign
herbicides).
In terms of the division of the environmental benefits associated with less insecticide and
herbicide use for farmers in developed countries relative to farmers in developing countries,
Table 7 shows a 53%:47% split of the environmental benefits (1996-2014) respectively in
developed (53%) and developing countries (47%). Seventy per cent of the environmental gains in
developing countries have been from the use of GM IR cotton.

It should, however, be noted that in some regions where GM HT crops have been widely grown,
some farmers have relied too much on the use of single herbicides like glyphosate to manage
weeds in GM HT crops and this has contributed to the development of weed resistance. There
are currently 35 weeds recognised as exhibiting resistance to glyphosate worldwide, of which
several are not associated with glyphosate tolerant crops (www.weedscience.org). For example,
there are currently 15 weeds recognised in the US as exhibiting resistance to glyphosate, of which
two are not associated with glyphosate tolerant crops. In the US, the affected area is currently
within a range of 30%-50% of the total area annually devoted to maize, cotton, canola, soybeans
and sugar beet (the crops in which GM HT technology is used).
In recent years, there has also been a growing consensus among weed scientists of a need for
changes in the weed management programmes in GM HT crops, because of the evolution of
these weeds towards populations that are resistant to glyphosate. Growers of GM HT crops are
increasingly being advised to be more proactive and include other herbicides (with different and
complementary modes of action) in combination with glyphosate in their integrated weed
management systems, even where instances of weed resistance to glyphosate have not been
found.
This proactive, diversified approach to weed management is the principal strategy for avoiding
the emergence of herbicide resistant weeds in GM HT crops. It is also the main way of tackling
weed resistance in conventional crops. A proactive weed management programme also
generally requires less herbicide, has a better environmental profile and is more economical than
a reactive weed management programme.
At the macro level, the adoption of both reactive and proactive weed management programmes
in GM HT crops has influenced the mix, total amount and overall environmental profile of
herbicides applied to GM HT soybeans, cotton, maize and canola in the last 7-10 years and this is
reflected in the data presented in this paper.

GM crop impact: 1996-2014

Impact on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions 7
The scope for GM crops contributing to lower levels of GHG emissions comes from two principal
sources:
6F

•

•

Reduced fuel use from less frequent herbicide or insecticide applications and a reduction
in the energy use in soil cultivation. The fuel savings associated with making fewer
spray runs (relative to conventional crops) and the switch to conservation, reduced and
no-till farming systems, have resulted in permanent savings in carbon dioxide emissions.
In 2014, this amounted to about 2,396 million kg (arising from reduced fuel use of 898
million litres). Over the period 1996 to 2014 the cumulative permanent reduction in fuel
use is estimated at 21,689 million kg of carbon dioxide (arising from reduced fuel use of
8,124 million litres);
The use of ‘no-till’ and ‘reduced-till’ 8 farming systems. These production systems have
increased significantly with the adoption of GM HT crops because the GM HT
technology has improved farmers’ ability to control competing weeds, reducing the need
to rely on soil cultivation and seed-bed preparation as means to getting good levels of
weed control. As a result, tractor fuel use for tillage is reduced, soil quality is enhanced
and levels of soil erosion cut. In turn more carbon remains in the soil and this leads to
lower GHG emissions. Based on savings arising from the rapid adoption of no
till/reduced tillage farming systems in North and South America, an extra 5,449 million
kg of soil carbon is estimated to have been sequestered in 2014 (equivalent to 19,998
million kg of carbon dioxide that has not been released into the global atmosphere).
Cumulatively, the amount of carbon sequestered is likely to be higher due to year-onyear benefits to soil quality; however, it is equally likely that the total cumulative soil
sequestration gains are not the sum of each individual year’s estimated saving because
only a proportion of the crop area will have remained in permanent no-till and reduced
tillage. It is not possible to confidently estimate cumulative soil sequestration gains that
take into account reversions to conventional tillage because of a lack of data.
Consequently, our estimate of 186,945 million kg of carbon dioxide not released into the
atmosphere for the cumulative period 1996-2014 should be treated with caution.
7F

Placing these carbon sequestration benefits within the context of the carbon emissions from cars,
Table 8 shows that:
•
•
•

•

In 2014, the permanent carbon dioxide savings from reduced fuel use were the equivalent
of removing 1.07 million cars from the road;
The additional probable soil carbon sequestration gains in 2014 were equivalent to
removing 8.89 million cars from the roads;
In total, in 2014, the combined GM crop-related carbon dioxide emission savings from
reduced fuel use and additional soil carbon sequestration were equal to the removal from
the roads of 9.95 million cars, equivalent to 34% of all registered cars in the UK;
It is not possible to confidently estimate the probable soil carbon sequestration gains
since 1996. If the entire GM HT crop in reduced or no tillage agriculture during the last
twenty years had remained in permanent reduced/no tillage then this would have

7

See section 4.2
No-till farming means that the ground is not ploughed at all, while reduced tillage means that the ground is disturbed less than it
would be with traditional tillage systems. For example, under a no-till farming system, soybean seeds are planted through the organic
material that is left over from a previous crop such as corn, cotton or wheat

resulted in a carbon dioxide saving of 186,945 million kg, equivalent to taking 83 million
cars off the road. This is, however, a maximum possibility and the actual levels of carbon
dioxide reduction are likely to be lower.

Concluding comments
Crop biotechnology has, to date, delivered several specific agronomic traits that have overcome a
number of production constraints for many farmers. This has resulted in improved productivity
and profitability for the 18 million adopting farmers who have applied the technology to 175.5
million hectares in 2014.
During the last nineteen years, this technology has made important positive socio-economic and
environmental contributions. These have arisen even though only a limited range of GM
agronomic traits have so far been commercialised, in a small range of crops.

©PG Economics Ltd 2016

GM crop impact: 1996-2014

The crop biotechnology has delivered economic and environmental gains through a combination
of their inherent technical advances and the role of the technology in the facilitation and
evolution of more cost effective and environmentally friendly farming practices. More
specifically:
•

•

•

The gains from the GM IR traits have mostly been delivered directly from the
technology (yield improvements, reduced production risk and decreased use of
insecticides). Thus farmers (mostly in developing countries) have been able to both
improve their productivity and economic returns, whilst also practising more
environmentally-friendly farming methods;
The gains from GM HT traits have come from a combination of direct benefits (mostly
cost reductions to the farmer) and the facilitation of changes in farming systems. Thus,
GM HT technology (especially in soybeans) has played an important role in enabling
farmers to capitalise on the availability of a low cost, broad-spectrum herbicide
(glyphosate) and, in turn, facilitated the move away from conventional to low/no-tillage
production systems in both North and South America. This change in production
system has made additional positive economic contributions to farmers (and the wider
economy) and delivered important environmental benefits, notably reduced levels of
GHG emissions (from reduced tractor fuel use and additional soil carbon
sequestration);
Both IR and HT traits have made important contributions to increasing world
production levels of soybeans, corn, cotton and canola.

In relation to HT crops, over reliance on the use of glyphosate and the lack of crop and herbicide
rotation by some farmers, in some regions, has contributed to the development of weed
resistance. In order to address this problem and maintain good levels of weed control, farmers
have increasingly adopted a mix of reactive and proactive weed management strategies
incorporating a mix of herbicides and other HT crops (in other words using other herbicides with
glyphosate rather than solely relying on glyphosate or using HT crops which are tolerant to other
herbicides, such as glufosinate). This has added cost to the GM HT production systems
compared to several years ago, although relative to the conventional alternative, the GM HT
technology continues to offer important economic benefits in 2014.
Overall, there is a considerable body of consistent evidence, in peer reviewed literature, and
summarised in this paper, that quantifies the positive economic and environmental impacts of
crop biotechnology. The analysis in this paper therefore provides insights into the reasons why
so many farmers around the world have adopted and continue to use the technology. Readers
are encouraged to read the peer reviewed papers cited, and the many others who have published
on this subject (and listed in the references section) and to draw their own conclusions.

1 Introduction
This study 9 examines the socio-economic impact on farm income and environmental impacts
arising from pesticide usage and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, of crop biotechnology, over
the nineteen-year period 1996-2014 10. It also quantifies the production impact of the technology
on the key crops where it has been used.

9F

1.1 Objectives
The principal objective of the study was to identify the global socio-economic and environmental
impact of genetically modified (GM) crops over the first nineteen years of widespread
commercial production.
More specifically, the report examines the following impacts:
Socio-economic impacts on:
• Cropping systems: risks of crop losses, use of inputs, crop yields and rotations;
• Farm profitability: costs of production, revenue and gross margin profitability;
• Indirect (non pecuniary) impacts of the technology;
• Production effects;
• Trade flows: developments of imports and exports and prices;
• Drivers for adoption such as farm type and structure
Environmental impacts on:
• Insecticide and herbicide use, including conversion to an environmental impact
measure 11;
• Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.
10 F

1.2 Methodology
The report has been compiled based largely on desk research and analysis. A detailed literature
review 12 has been undertaken to identify relevant data. Primary data for impacts of commercial
cultivation were not available for every crop, in every year and for each country, but all
representative, previous research has been utilised. The findings of this research have been used
as the basis for the analysis presented 13, although where relevant, we have undertaken primary
analysis from base data (eg, calculation of the environmental impacts). More specific information
about assumptions used and their origins are provided in each of the sections of the report.

2 Global context of GM crops
This section provides a broad overview of the global development of GM crops over the
nineteen-year period 1996-2014.

2.1 Global plantings
Although the first commercial GM crops were planted in 1994 (tomatoes), 1996 was the first year
in which a significant area of crops containing GM traits were planted (1.66 million hectares).
Since then there has been a dramatic increase in plantings and by 2014, the global planted area
was 175.5 million hectares.
In terms of the share of the main crops in which GM traits have been commercialised (soybeans,
maize/corn, cotton and canola), GM traits accounted for 48% of the global plantings to these four
crops in 2014.

2.2 Plantings by crop and trait
2.2.1 By crop
Almost all of the global GM crop area derives from soybeans, maize/corn, cotton and canola
(Figure 1) 14. In 2014, GM soybeans accounted for the largest share (50%), followed by corn (31%),
cotton (14%) and canola (5%).

In 2014 there were also additional GM crop plantings of papaya (435 hectares), squash (2,000 hectares), sugar beet (455,000 ha) and
alfalfa (about 1.3 million ha) in the US. There were also 8,475 hectares of papaya in China, 15,000 of sugar beet in Canada and 12 ha
of insect resistant brinjal in Bangladesh

In terms of the share of total global plantings to these four crops, GM traits accounted for the
majority of soybean plantings (75%) in 2014. For the other three main crops, the GM shares in
2014 were 30% for maize/corn, 74% for cotton and 25% for canola (Figure 2).

10% 15. In total, HT crops account for 65%, and insect resistant crops account for 35% of global
plantings.

The reader should note that the total plantings by trait produces a higher global planted area (227.7 million ha) than the global area
by crop (175.5 million ha) because of the planting of some crops containing the stacked traits of herbicide tolerance and insect
resistance

In terms of the GM share of production in the main adopting countries,
Table 9 shows that, in 2014, the technology accounted for important shares of total production of
the four main crops, in several countries. More specifically:
• US: was one of the first countries to adopt the technology in 1996 for traits in soybeans,
maize and cotton, and from 1999 in canola, hence the very high adoption levels that
have been reached in 2014. Almost all of the US sugar beet crop (98%) also used GM HT
technology in 2014;
• Canada and Argentina: like the US were early adopters, with the technology now
dominating production in the three crops of soybeans, maize and canola in Canada, and
maize, cotton and soybeans in Argentina;
• South Africa: was the first, and remains the primary African country 16 to embrace the
technology, which was first used commercially in 2000. The technology is widely used
in the important crops of maize and soybeans, and now accounts for all of the small
cotton crop (15,000 ha in 2014);
• Australia: was an early adopter of GM technology in cotton (1996), with GM traits now
accounting for almost all cotton production. Extension of the technology to other crops
did, however, not occur until 2008 when HT canola was allowed in some Australian
states;
• In Asia, six countries used GM crops in 2014. China was the first Asian country to use the
technology commercially back in 1997 when GM IR technology was first used. This
technology rapidly expanded to about two thirds of the total crop within five years and
has recently increased to over 90% in 2014. GM virus resistant papaya has also been
used in China since 2008. In India, IR cotton was first adopted in 2002, and its use
increased rapidly in subsequent years, so that by 2014 this technology dominates total
15 F

The only other African countries where commercial GM crops grew in 2014 were Burkina Faso (first used commercially in 2008,
IR cotton now accounts for 73% (454,000 ha) of the total crop) and Sudan, first grown commercially in 2012 and where GM IR cotton
was planted on 90,000 ha in 2014

cotton production (92% of the total). IR cotton is also grown in Pakistan and Myanmar.
In the Philippines, IR maize was first used commercially in 2003, with HT maize also
adopted from 2006. Lastly, Vietnam adopted IR/HT maize in 2015;
• In South America, there are interesting country examples where the adoption of GM
technology in one country resulted in a spread of the technology, initially illegally,
across borders into countries which were first reluctant to legalise the use of the
technology. Thus GM HT soybeans were first grown illegally in the southernmost states
of Brazil in 1997, a year after legal adoption in Argentina. It was not until 2003 that the
Brazilian government legalised the commercial growing of GM HT soybeans, when
more than 10% of the country’s soybean crop had been using the technology illegally (in
2002). Since then, GM technology use has extended to cotton in 2006 and maize in 2008.
A similar process of widespread illegal adoption of GM HT soybeans occurred in
Paraguay and Bolivia before the respective governments authorised the planting of
soybean crops using this GM trait. Intacta soybeans (insect resistant and herbicide
tolerant) were also adopted in Brazil, Paraguay, Argentina and Uruguay from 2013.

GM crop impact: 1996-2014

3 The farm level economic impact of GM crops 19962014
This section examines the farm level economic impact of growing GM crops and covers the
following main issues:
•
•
•
•
•

•

Impact on crop yields;
Effect on key costs of production, notably seed cost and crop protection expenditure;
Impact on other costs such as fuel and labour;
Effect on profitability;
Other impacts such as crop quality, scope for planting a second crop in a season and
impacts that are often referred to as intangible impacts such as convenience, risk
management and husbandry flexibility;
Production effects.

The analysis is based on an extensive examination of existing farm level impact data for GM
crops. Whilst primary data for impacts of commercial cultivation were not available for every
crop, in every year and for each country, a substantial body of representative research and
analysis is available and this has been used as the basis for the analysis presented.
As the economic performance and impact of this technology at the farm level varies widely, both
between and within regions/countries (as applies to any technology used in agriculture), the
measurement of performance and impact is considered on a case by case basis in terms of crop
and trait combinations. The analysis presented is based on the average performance and impact
recorded in different crops by the studies reviewed; the average performance being the most
common way in which the identified literature has reported impact. Where several pieces of
relevant research (eg, on the impact of using a GM trait on the yield of a crop in one country in a
particular year) have been identified, the findings used have been largely based on the average of
these findings.
This approach may overstate or understate the real impact of GM technology for some trait, crop
and country combinations, especially in cases where the technology has provided yield
enhancements. However, as impact data for every trait, crop, location and year is not available,
the authors have had to extrapolate available impact data from identified studies for years for
which no data are available. It is acknowledged that this represents a potential methodological
weakness of the research. To reduce the possibilities of over/understating impact, the analysis:
•

Directly applies impacts identified from the literature to the years that have been studied.
As a result, the impacts used vary in many cases according to the findings of literature
covering different years 17. Hence, the analysis takes into account variation in the impact
of the technology on yield according to its effectiveness in dealing with (annual)
fluctuations in pest and weed infestation levels as identified by research;
16F

17

Examples where such data is available include the impact of GM (IR cotton: in India (see Bennett et al (2004), IMRB (2006) and
IMRB (2007)), in Mexico (see Traxler et al (2001) and Monsanto Mexico (annual reports to the Mexican government)) and in the US
(see Sankala & Blumenthal (2003 and 2006), Mullins & Hudson (2004))

GM crop impact: 1996-2014

•

•

•

Uses current farm level crop prices and bases any yield impacts on (adjusted – see below)
current average yields. In this way some degree of dynamic has been introduced into the
analysis that would, otherwise, be missing if constant prices and average yields identified
in year-specific studies had been used;
Includes some changes and updates to the impact assumptions identified in the literature
based on consultation with local sources (analysts, industry representatives) so as to
better reflect prevailing/changing conditions (eg, pest and weed pressure, cost of
technology);
Adjusts downwards the average base yield (in cases where GM technology has been
identified as having delivered yield improvements) on which the yield enhancement has
been applied. In this way, the impact on total production is not overstated (see
Appendix 1 for examples).

Appendix 2 also provides details of the impacts, assumptions applied and sources.
Other aspects of the methodology used to estimate the impact on direct farm income are as
follows:
•

•

•

Impact is quantified at the trait and crop level, including where stacked traits are
available to farmers. Where stacked traits have been used, the individual trait
components were analysed separately to ensure estimates of all traits were calculated;
All values presented are nominal for the year shown and the base currency used is the
US dollar. All financial impacts in other currencies have been converted to US dollars at
prevailing annual average exchange rates for each year;
The analysis focuses on changes in farm income in each year arising from impact of GM
technology on yields, key costs of production (notably seed cost and crop protection
expenditure, but also impact on costs such as fuel and labour 18), crop quality (eg,
improvements in quality arising from less pest damage or lower levels of weed
impurities which result in price premia being obtained from buyers) and the scope for
facilitating the planting of a second crop in a season (eg, second crop soybeans in
Argentina following wheat that would, in the absence of the GM herbicide tolerant (GM
HT) seed, probably not have been planted). Thus, the farm income effect measured is
essentially a gross margin impact (impact on gross revenue less variable costs of
production) rather than a full net cost of production assessment. Through the inclusion
of yield impacts and the application of actual (average) farm prices for each year, the
analysis also indirectly takes into account the possible impact of biotech crop adoption on
global crop supply and world prices.
17 F

The section also examines some of the more intangible (more difficult to quantify) economic
impacts of GM technology. The literature in this area is much more limited and in terms of
aiming to quantify these impacts, largely restricted to the US-specific studies. The findings of this
research are summarised 19 and extrapolated to the cumulative biotech crop planted areas in the
US over the period 1996-2014.
18F

18
Where available – information and analysis on these costs is more limited than the impacts on seed and crop protection costs
because only a few of the papers reviewed have included consideration of such costs. In most cases the analysis relates to impact of
crop protection and seed cost only

GM crop impact: 1996-2014

Lastly, the paper includes estimates of the production impacts of GM technology at the crop
level. These have been aggregated to provide the reader with a global perspective of the broader
production impact of the technology. These impacts derive from the yield impacts (where
identified), but also from the facilitation of additional cropping within a season (notably in
relation to soybeans in South America).
The section is structured on a trait and country basis highlighting the key farm level impacts.

3.1 Herbicide tolerant soybeans
3.1.1 The US
First generation GM HT soybeans
In 2014, 94% (31.4 million ha) of the total US soybean crop was planted to GM HT cultivars. Of
this, 11.2 million ha were first generation GM HT soybeans. The farm level impact of using this
technology since 1996 is summarised in Table 10.
The key features are as follows:
•

The primary impact has been to reduce the cost of production. In the early years of
adoption these savings were between $25/ha and $34/ha. In more recent years, estimates
of the cost savings have been in the range of $30/ha and $85/ha (based on a comparison of
conventional herbicide regimes that are required to deliver a comparable level of weed
control to the GM HT soybean system). In the period between 2008 and 2010, the cost
savings declined relative to earlier years, mainly because of the significant increase in the
global price of glyphosate relative to increases in the price of other herbicides (commonly
used on conventional soybeans). In addition, growers of GM HT soybean crops are
increasingly faced with the problem of weed species becoming resistant to glyphosate.
This has resulted in the need to include use of other herbicides (with different and
complementary modes of action) in combination with glyphosate to address the weed
resistance (to glyphosate) issues (see section 4 for more detailed discussion of this issue).
At the macro level, these changes have influenced the mix, volume; cost and overall
profile of herbicides applied to GM HT soybeans in the last 7-10 years, and is shown here
by the annually changing levels of cost savings associated with the adoption of GM HT
technology. Overall, the main benefit of the technology has been cost savings associated
with lower herbicide costs 20 plus a saving in labour and machinery costs of between
about $6/ha and $10/ha;
Against the background of underlying improvements in average yield levels over the
1996-2014 period (via improvements in plant breeding, including the adoption of second
generation HT soybeans – see below), the specific yield impact of the first generation of
GM HT technology used up to 2014 has been neutral 21;

Whilst there were initial cost savings in herbicide expenditure, these increased when glyphosate came off-patent in 2000. Growers
of GM HT soybeans initially applied Monsanto’s Roundup herbicide but over time, and with the availability of low cost generic
glyphosate alternatives, many growers switched to using these generic alternatives (the price of Roundup also fell significantly post
2000)
21
Some early studies of the impact of GM HT soybeans in the US suggested that GM HT soybeans produced lower yields than
conventional soybean varieties. Where this may have occurred it applied only in early years of adoption, when the technology was not
present in all leading varieties suitable for all of the main growing regions of the USA. By 1998/99 the technology was available in

The annual total national farm income benefit from using the technology rose from $5
million in 1996 to $1.42 billion in 2007. Since then the aggregate farm income gains have
fluctuated, with the 2014 gain being $165 million. The cumulative farm income benefit
over the 1996-2014 period (in nominal terms) was $12.93 billion.

Blumenthal, which was to examine the conventional herbicide regime that would be required to
deliver the same level of weed control in a low/reduced till system to that delivered from the GM
HT no/reduced till soybean system. This is a more robust methodology than some of the more
simplistic alternatives used elsewhere. In earlier years the cost savings were based on comparisons
between GM HT soy growers and/or conventional herbicide regimes that were commonplace prior
to commercialisation in the mid 1990s when conventional tillage systems were more important

Second generation GM HT soybeans
A second generation of GM HT soybeans became available to commercial soybean growers in the
US in 2009. It was planted on 21 million ha in 2014 (63% of the total crop). The technology

varieties

offered the same tolerance to glyphosate as the first generation (and the same cost saving) but
with higher yielding potential. Pre-launch trials of the technology suggested that average yields
would increase by between +7% and +11%. In assessing the impact on yield of this new
generation of GM HT soybeans since 2009, it is important to recognise that only limited seed was
initially available for planting in 2009 and the trait was not available in many of the leading (best
performing) varieties. As a result, reports of first year performance 22 were varied when
compared with the first generation of GM HT soybeans (which was available in all leading
varieties), with some farmers reporting no improvement in yield relative to first generation GM
HT soybeans whilst others found significant improvements in yield, of up to +10%. In 2010,
when the trait was available in many more of the leading varieties, farmer feedback to the
seed/technology providers reports average yield improvements of about +5%. In subsequent
years, the average yield gains reported were higher in the range of +9% to +11% (+9% 2014)
relative to first generation GM HT and conventional soybean crops. Applying these yield gains
plus the same cost saving assumptions as applied to first generation GM HT soybeans, but with a
seed premium of $65.21/ha for 2009, $50.14/ha for 2010, $62.5 for 2011, $57.7/ha in 2012, $62.05/ha
in 2013 and $52.76/ha in 2014, the net impact on farm income in 2014, inclusive of yield gain, was
+$131.1/ha. Aggregated to the national level this was equal to an improvement in farm income of
$2.76 billion in 2014 and cumulatively since 2009, the total farm income gain has been $8.46
billion. The technology also increased US soybean production by 5.68 million tonnes since 2009.
21 F

3.1.2 Argentina
As in the US, first generation GM HT soybeans were first planted commercially in 1996. Since
then, use of the technology has increased rapidly and almost all soybeans grown in Argentina are
GM HT (99%). The impact on farm income has been substantial, with farmers deriving important
cost saving and farm income benefits both similar and additional to those obtained in the US
(Table 11). More specifically:
•
•

•

The impact on yield has been neutral (ie, no positive or negative yield impact);
The cost of the technology to Argentine farmers has been substantially lower than in the
US (about $1/ha-$4/ha compared to $15/ha-$50/ha in the US) mainly because the main
technology provider (Monsanto) was not able to obtain patent protection for the
technology in Argentina. As such, Argentine farmers have been free to save and use GM
seed without paying any technology fees or royalties (on farm-saved seed) for many
years;
The savings from reduced expenditure on herbicides, fewer spray runs and machinery
use have been in the range of $24-$30/ha, although since 2008, savings fell back to $16/ha$26/ha because of the significant increase in the price of glyphosate relative to other
herbicides in 2008-09 and additional expenditure on complementary herbicide use to
address weed resistance (to glyphosate) issues. Net income gains have been in the range
of $21-$29/ha up to 2007 23 and $14/ha-$24/ha since 2008;
The price received by farmers for GM HT soybeans in the early years of adoption was, on
average, marginally higher than for conventionally produced soybeans, because of lower
22F

22

The authors are not aware of any survey-based assessment of performance in 2009
This income gain also includes the benefits accruing from the fall in real price of glyphosate, which fell by about a third between
1996 and 2000

levels of weed material and impurities in the crop. This quality premia was equivalent to
about 0.5% of the baseline price for soybeans (not applied in the analysis in recent years);
The net income gain from use of the GM HT technology at a national level was $436
million in 2014. Since 1996, the cumulative benefit (in nominal terms) has been $5.57
billion;
An additional farm income benefit that many Argentine soybean growers have derived
comes from the additional scope for second cropping of soybeans. This has arisen
because of the simplicity, ease and weed management flexibility provided by the (GM)
technology which has been an important factor facilitating the use of no and reduced
tillage production systems. In turn the adoption of low/no tillage production systems has
reduced the time required for harvesting and drilling subsequent crops and hence has
enabled many Argentine farmers to cultivate two crops (wheat followed by soybeans) in
one season. About 20% of the total Argentine soybean crop was second crop in 2014 24,
compared to 8% in 1996. Based on the additional gross margin income derived from
second crop soybeans (see Appendix 2), this has contributed a further boost to national
soybean farm income of $784 million in 2014 and $10.87 billion cumulatively since 1996;
The total farm income benefit inclusive of the second cropping was $1.22 billion in 2014
and $16.43 billion cumulatively between 1996 and 2014.

GM crop impact: 1996-2014

5.

The primary source of information for impact on the costs of production is Qaim & Traxler (2002 &
2005). This has been updated in recent years to reflect changes in herbicide prices and weed
control practices
All values for prices and costs denominated in Argentine pesos have been converted to US dollars
at the annual average exchange rate in each year
The second cropping benefits are based on the gross margin derived from second crop soybeans
multiplied by the total area of second crop soybeans (less an assumed area of second crop soybeans
that equals the second crop area in 1996 – this was discontinued from 2004 because of the
importance farmers attach to the GM HT system in facilitating them remaining in no tillage
production systems). The source of gross margin data comes from Grupo CEO and the Argentine
Ministry of Agriculture
Additional information is available in Appendix 2
The net savings to costs understate the total gains in recent years because 70%-80% of GM HT
plantings have been to farm-saved seed on which no seed premium was payable (relative to the $3$4/ha premium charged for new seed)

3.1.3 Brazil
GM HT soybeans were probably first planted in Brazil in 1997. Since then, the area planted has
increased to 93% of the total crop in 2014 25.
24F

The impact of using GM HT soybeans has been similar to that identified in the US and Argentina.
The net savings on herbicide costs have been larger in Brazil, due to higher average costs of weed
control. Hence, the average cost savings arising from a combination of reduced herbicide use,
fewer spray runs, labour and machinery savings, were between $30/ha and $81/ha in the period
2003 to 2014 (Table 12). The net cost saving after deduction of the technology fee (assumed to be
about $11/ha in 2014) has been between $9/ha and $60/ha in recent years. At a national level, the
adoption of GM HT soybeans increased farm income levels by $725 million in 2014.
Cumulatively over the period 1997 to 2014, farm incomes have risen by $6.32 billion (in nominal
terms).

3.1.4 Paraguay and Uruguay
GM HT soybeans have been grown since 1999 and 2000 respectively in Paraguay and Uruguay.
In 2014, they accounted for 95% of total soybean plantings in Paraguay and 80% of the soybean
plantings in Uruguay 26. Using the farm level impact data derived from Argentine research (on
conventional alternatives) and applying this to production in these two countries together with
updating of GM HT production that reflects changes in herbicide usage and cost data (source
AMIS Global) 27, Figure 6 summarises the national farm level income benefits that have been
derived from using the technology. In 2014, the respective national farm income gains were $37.2
million in Paraguay ($105.7 million including second crop benefits) and $16.2 million in Uruguay.

First generation GM HT soybeans
GM HT soybeans were first planted in Canada in 1997. In 2014, the share of total plantings
accounted for by first generation GM HT soybeans was 6% (0.13 million ha).
At the farm level, the main impacts of use have been similar to the impacts in the US. The
average farm income benefit has been within a range of $14/ha-$45/ha and the increase in farm
income at the national level was $2.3 million in 2014 (Table 13). The cumulative increase in farm
income since 1997 has been $165.7 million (in nominal terms).

Second generation GM HT soybeans
As in the US, 2009 was the first year of commercial availability of second generation GM HT
soybeans. Seed containing this trait was planted on 1.2 million ha in 2014, equal to 54% of the
total crop. In the absence of Canadian-specific impact data, we have applied the same cost of
technology and yield impact assumptions as used in the analysis of impact in the US. On this
basis, the net impact on farm income was +$95.6/ha in 2014, with an aggregate increase in farm
income of +$116 million. Since 2009, the total farm income gain has been $447.6 million.

3.1.6 South Africa
The first year GM HT soybeans were planted commercially in South Africa was 2001. In 2014
618,000 hectares (90%) of total soybean plantings were to varieties containing the GM HT trait. In
terms of impact at the farm level, net cost savings of between $1/ha and $9/ha have been achieved
through reduced expenditure on herbicides (Table 14). At the national level, the increase in farm
income was $4.9 million in 2014. Cumulatively the farm income gain since 2001 has been $18.1
million 28.

3.1.7 Romania
In 2012, farmers in Romania are not permitted to plant GM HT soybeans, having joined the EU at
the start of 2007 (the EU regulatory authorities have not completed the process of evaluating past
applications for the approval for planting GM HT soybeans and currently there is no ongoing
application for approval for planting first generation GM HT soybeans in the EU). The impact
data presented below therefore covers the period 1999-2006.
The growing of GM HT soybeans in Romania had resulted in substantially greater net farm
income gains per hectare than any of the other countries using the technology:
•

Yield gains of an average of 31% 29 have been recorded. This yield gain has arisen from
the substantial improvements in weed control 30. In recent years, as fields have been
cleaned of problem weeds, the average yield gains have decreased and were reported at
+13% in 2006 31;
The cost of the technology to farmers in Romania tended to be higher than other
countries, with seed being sold in conjunction with the herbicide. For example, in the
2002-2006 period, the average cost of seed and herbicide per hectare was $120/ha to
$130/ha. This relatively high cost, however, did not deter adoption of the technology
because of the major yield gains, improvements in the quality of soybeans produced
(less weed material in the beans sold to crushers which resulted in price premia being
obtained 32) and cost savings derived;
The average net increase in gross margin in 2006 was $59/ha (an average of $105/ha over
the eight years of commercial use: Table 15);
At the national level, the increase in farm income amounted to $7.6 million in 2006.
Cumulatively in the period 1999-2006 the increase in farm income was $44.6 million (in
nominal terms);
The yield gains in 2006 were equivalent to a 9% increase in national production 33 (the
annual average increase in production over the eight years was equal to 10.1%).

Weed infestation levels, particularly of difficult to control weeds such as Johnson grass, have been very high in Romania. This is
largely a legacy of the economic transition during the 1990s which resulted in very low levels of farm income, abandonment of land
and very low levels of weed control. As a result, the weed bank developed substantially and has subsequently been very difficult to
control, until the GM HT soybean system became available (glyphosate has been the key to controlling difficult weeds like Johnson
grass)

3.1.8 Mexico
GM HT soybeans were first planted commercially in Mexico in 1997 (on a trial basis), and in 2014,
a continued ‘trial area’ of 17,800 ha (out of total plantings of 193,000 ha) were varieties containing
the GM HT trait.
At the farm level, the main impacts of use have been a combination of yield increase (+9.1% in
2004 and 2005, +3.64% in 2006, +3.2% 2007, +2.4% 2008, +13% in 2009, +4% 2010-2012, +9.9% 2013
and -2% in 2014) and (herbicide) cost savings. The average farm income benefit has been within a
range of $9/ha-$89/ha (inclusive of yield gain, cost savings and after payment of the technology
fee/seed premium although in 2014, the income effect was broadly neutral (reflecting a small
yield loss relative to the average yield for conventional soybeans grown in the regions where GM
HT soybeans were trialed).

3.1.9 Bolivia
GM HT soybeans were officially permitted for planting in 2009, although ‘illegal’ plantings have
occurred for several years. For the purposes of analysis in this section, impacts have been
calculated back to 2005, when an estimated 0.3 million ha of soybeans used GM HT technology.
In 2014, 1.1 million ha (83% of total crop) used GM HT technology.
The main impacts of the technology 34 have been (Table 17):

•

An increase in yield arising from improved yield control. The research work conducted
by Fernandez et al (2009) estimated a 30% yield difference between GM HT and
conventional soybeans; although some of the yield gain reflected the use of poor quality
conventional seed by some farmers. In our analysis, we have used a more conservative
yield gain of +15% (based on industry views);
GM HT soybeans are assumed to trade at a price discount to conventional soybeans of
2.7%, reflecting the higher price set for conventional soybeans by the Bolivian
government in 2014;
The cost of the technology to farmers has been $3.3/ha and the cost savings equal to
$9.3/ha, resulting in a change of +$6/ha to the overall cost of production;
Overall in 2014, the average farm income gain from using GM HT soybeans was about
$101/ha, resulting in a total farm income gain of $107 million. Cumulatively since 2005,
the total farm income gain is estimated at $636 million.

GM crop impact: 1996-2014

3.1.10 Summary of global economic impact
In global terms, the farm level impact of using GM HT technology in soybeans (excluding Intacta:
see section 3.2) was $4.37 billion in 2014 (Figure 9). If the second crop benefits arising in
Argentina are included this rises to $5.22 billion. Cumulatively since 1996, the farm income
benefit has been (in nominal terms) $35.2 billion ($46.6 billion if second crop gains in Argentina
and Paraguay are included).
In terms of the total value of global soybean production in 2014, the additional farm income
(inclusive of Argentine second crop gains) generated by the technology is equal to a value added
equivalent of 4.2%.
These economic benefits should be placed within the context of a significant increase in the level
of soybean production in the main GM adopting countries since 1996 (a 102% increase in the area
planted in the leading soybean producing countries of the US, Brazil and Argentina).
Figure 7: Global farm level income benefits derived from using GM HT soybeans 1996-2014
(million $)

These economic benefits mostly derive from cost savings although farmers in Mexico, Bolivia and
Romania also obtained yield gains (from significant improvements in weed control levels relative
to levels applicable prior to the introduction of the technology). In addition, the availability of
second generation GM HT soybeans in North America since 2009 is also delivering yield gains. If
it is also assumed that all of the second crop soybean gains are effectively additional production
that would not otherwise have occurred without the GM HT technology (the GM HT technology
facilitated major expansion of second crop soybeans in Argentina and to a lesser extent in
Paraguay), then these gains are de facto 'yield' gains. Under this assumption, of the total
cumulative farm income gains from using GM HT soybeans, $21.3 billion (46%) is due to yield
gains/second crop benefits and the balance, 54%, is due to cost savings.

Herbicide tolerant maize 35 has been used commercially in the US since 1997 and in 2014 was
planted on 89% of the total US maize crop. The impact of using this technology at the farm level
is summarised in Figure 8. As with herbicide tolerant soybeans, the main benefit has been to
reduce costs, and hence improve profitability levels. Average profitability improved by $20/ha$36/ha in most years, although in 2008-09 this fell to a range of $12/ha-$16/ha, largely due to the
significant increase in glyphosate prices relative to other herbicides. The net gain to farm income
in 2014 was $1,083 million and cumulatively, since 1997, the farm income benefit has been $6.1
billion.

3.3.2 Canada
In Canada, GM HT maize was first planted commercially in 1999. In 2014, the proportion of total
plantings accounted for by varieties containing a GM HT trait was 97%. As in the US, the main
benefit has been to reduce costs and to improve profitability levels. Average annual profitability
has improved by between $12/ha and $18/ha up to 2007, but fell in 2008-09 to under $10/ha due
mainly to the higher price increases for glyphosate relative to other herbicides. In 2014, the net
increase in farm income was $27.9 million and cumulatively since 1999 the farm income benefit
has been $137.4 million (Figure 9).

3.3.3 Argentina
GM HT maize was first planted commercially in Argentina in 2004, and in 2014 varieties
containing a GM HT trait were planted on 3.8 million ha (64% of the total maize area). It has been
adopted in two distinct types of area, the majority (80%) in the traditional ‘corn production belt’
and 20% in newer maize-growing regions, which have traditionally been known as more
marginal areas that surround the ‘Corn Belt’. The limited adoption of GM HT technology in
Argentina up to 2006 was mainly due to the technology only being available as a single gene, not
stacked with the GM IR trait, which most maize growers have also adopted. Hence, faced with
either a GM HT or a GM IR trait available for use, most farmers have chosen the GM IR trait
because the additional returns derived from adoption have tended to be (on average) greater
from the GM IR trait than the GM HT trait (see below for further details of returns from the GM
HT trait). Stacked traits became available in 2007 and contributed to the significant increase in
the GM HT maize area in subsequent years. In 2014, stacked-traited seed accounted for 89% of
the total GM HT area.
In relation to impact on farm income, this can be examined from two perspectives; as a single GM
HT trait and as a stacked trait. This differential nature of impact largely reflects the locations in
which the different (single or stacked-traited seed) has tended to be used:
Single GM HT traited seed
• In all regions the cost of the technology (about $20-$30/ha) has been broadly equal to the
saving in herbicide costs;
• In the ‘Corn Belt’ area, use of the single trait technology has resulted in an average 3%
yield improvement via improved weed control. In the more marginal areas, the yield

•

impact has been much more significant (+22%) as farmers have been able to significantly
improve weed control levels;
In 2014, the additional farm income at a national level, from using single traited GM HT
technology, has been +$29.8 million, and cumulatively since 2004, the income gain has
been $246.3 million.

Stacked traited GM HT seed
• The average yield gain identified since adoption has been +15.75% 36. Given the average
yield impact identified for the early years of adoption of the single traited GM IR maize
was +5.5% (see section 3.7), our analysis has applied this level of impact to the GM IR
component of the study (section 3.7), with the balance attributed to the GM HT trait.
Hence, for the purposes of this analysis, the assumed yield effect of the GM HT trait on
the area planted to GM stacked maize seed is +10.25%;
• The cost of the technology (seed premium) applied to GM HT component has been in a
range of $19/ha to $41/ha, with the impact on costs of production (other than seed)
assumed to be the same as for single-traited seed;
• Based on these assumptions, the net impact on farm income in 2014 was +$62.8ha, giving
an aggregated national level farm income gain of $213 million. Cumulatively since 2007,
the farm income gain has been $996.6 million.

3.3.4 South Africa
Herbicide tolerant maize has been grown commercially in South Africa since 2003, and in 2014,
1.99 million hectares out of total plantings of 3 million hectares used this trait. Farmers using the
technology have found small net savings in the cost of production (ie, the cost saving from
reduced expenditure on herbicides has been greater than the cost of the technology), although in
2008 and 2009, due to the significant rise in the global price of glyphosate relative to other
herbicides, the net farm income balance has been negative, at about -$2/ha. In 2014, the net
impact of use of the technology was +$12.4/ha. At the national level, this is equivalent to a net
gain of about $24.6 million. Since 2003, there has been a net cumulative income gain of $48.3
million. Readers should note that these cost savings do not take into consideration any labour
cost saving that may arise from reduced need for hand weeding. For example, Regier G et al
(2013) identified amongst small farmers in KwaZulu-Natal, savings of over $80/ha from reduced
requirement for hand weeding with the adoption of GM HT maize. Also it should be noted that
Gouse et al (2012) found that small farmers (who account for about 5% of total maize production)
obtained yield gains of between +3% and +8% when using this technology relative to
conventional maize growing in which hand weeding was the primary form of weed control
practice.

3.3.5 Philippines
GM HT maize was first grown commercially in 2006, and in 2014 was planted on 688,000
hectares. The impact of the technology in the first two years of adoption (based on industry
sources) was of average yield gains of 15%. Based on a cost of the technology of $24-$27/ha (and
assuming no net cost savings), the net national impacts on farm income in 2006 and 2007 were
+$0.98 million and +$10.4 million respectively. More detailed analysis by Gonsales et al (2009)
identified an average yield gain of +5%, the same cost of technology of $24/ha-$27/ha and a cost

GM crop impact: 1996-2014

saving (reduced weed control costs from reduced cost of herbicides and less hand weeding) of
$35/ha-$51/ha. These cost estimates have formed the basis of our analysis in subsequent years,
although the mix of herbicides used, their prices and the cost of the technology have been
adjusted based on industry and market research sources (AMIS Global). In 2014, our estimates
are that the net farm income gain from using GM HT maize was +$26.9/ha, which at the national
level was equal to +$18.5 million. Cumulatively, since 2006, the total farm income gain has been
$141.6 million.

3.3.6 Brazil
2014 was the fifth year in which GM HT maize was planted in Brazil (on 50% of the total crop:
7.98 million ha). Based on analysis by Galvao (2010-2014), the technology is estimated to have
delivered a yield gain of 2.5% in 2010, 3.6% in 2011 and 6.8% in 2012 and 2013 and +3% in 2014.
The technology (seed premium) costs have been in the range of $16/ha-$32/ha. In net farm
income terms, inclusive of yield gain, the average farm income gain has been between $25/ha and
$80/ha. At the national level, the farm income gain was $201 million in 2014, and $1.37 billion for
the five years.

3.3.7 Colombia
GM HT maize was first planted in Colombia in 2009 and in 2014, 54,850 ha (11% of the total crop)
used this technology (in the form of stacked traited seed, with GM IR technology). Analysis of its
impact is limited, with a recent study by Mendez et al (2011) being the only publicly available
material. This analysis focused only on a small area in one region of the country (San Juan valley)
and therefore is unlikely to be fully representative of (potential) impact across the country.
Nevertheless, as this represents the only available data, we have included it for illustrative
purposes. The analysis identified a positive yield impact of +22% for the stacked traited seed (HT
tolerance to glufosinate and IR resistance to corn boring pests) and for the purposes of our
analysis, all of this yield gain has been included/attributed to the GM IR component of the
technology, as presented in section 3.7.8. In terms of impact of costs of production, the GM HT
part is estimated to have had a net positive impact on profitability of about $15.3/ha in 2014 (seed
premium of $22/ha, counterbalanced by weed control cost savings of $37/ha). At the national
level, the total 2014 income gain was $0.8 million ($3.76 million since 2009).

3.3.8 Uruguay
Maize farmers in Uruguay gained access to GM HT maize technology in 2011 (via stacked traited
seed) and 66,570 ha of the country’s 82,700 ha crop used this technology in 2014. Whilst the
authors are not aware of any studies examining the impact of GM HT maize in Uruguay,
applying impact and cost assumptions based on the neighbouring Argentina, suggests small
levels of farm income gains of about $6.7/ha, equal to about $0.45 million at the national level in
2013 ($1.16 million for the four years).

3.3.9 Paraguay
GM HT technology was used for the first time in 2013 in Paraguay, and in 2014, half of the
country’s maize crop (500,000 ha) used seed containing this trait. Based on a seed premium of

GM crop impact: 1996-2014

$17.1ha (source: industry) and an estimated herbicide cost saving of about $17.5/ha (sources:
industry and AMIS Global 2013), the farm income gain was about $1/ha. At the national level,
this was equal to about $0.5 million.

3.3.9 Summary of global economic impact
In global terms, the farm level economic impact of using GM HT technology in maize was $1.6
billion in 2014 (68% of which was in the US). Cumulatively since 1997, the farm income benefit
has been (in nominal terms) $9 billion. Of this, 70% has been due to cost savings and 30% to yield
gains (from improved weed control relative to the level of weed control achieved by farmers
using conventional technology).
The additional farm income generated by the technology is equal to a value added equivalent of
1% of global maize production.

3.4 Herbicide tolerant cotton
3.4.1 The US
GM HT cotton was first grown commercially in the US in 1997 and in 2014 was planted on 91% of
total cotton plantings 37.
36F

The farm income impact of using GM HT cotton is summarised in Table 19. The primary benefit
has been to reduce costs, and hence improve profitability levels, with annual average profitability
increasing by between $21/ha and $49/ha 38 in the years up to 2004. Since then net income gains
fell to between $3/ha and $18/ha. In 2014, the net income gain was $14/ha. The relatively smaller
positive impact on direct farm income in recent years reflects a combination of reasons, including
the higher cost of the technology, significant price increases for glyphosate relative to price
increases for other herbicides in 2008-09 and changes in weed control practices (additional costs)
for the management of weeds resistant to glyphosate (notably Palmer Amaranth), as farmers have
increasingly adopted integrated weed management strategies based on the use of mix of
herbicides that complement the use of glyphosate. Overall, the net direct farm income impact in
2014 is estimated to be $47.5 million (this does not take into consideration any non pecuniary
benefits associated with adoption of the technology: see section 3.10). Cumulatively since 1997
there has been a net farm income benefit from using the technology of $1.07 billion.

The only published source that has examined the impact of HT cotton in the US is work by Carpenter & Gianessi (2002), Sankala &
Blumenthal (2003 & 2006) and Johnson & Strom (2008). In the 2001 study the costs saved were based on historic patterns of
herbicides used on conventional cotton in the mid/late 1990s. The latter studies estimated cost savings on the basis of the
conventional herbicide treatment that would be required to deliver the same level of weed control as GM HT cotton. Revised analysis
has, however, been conducted annually from 2008 to reflect changes in the costs of production (notably cost of the technology, in
particular ‘Roundup Ready Flex technology’), higher prices for glyphosate relative to other herbicides particularly in 2008 & 2009 and
additional costs incurred to control weeds resistant to glyphosate

3.4.2 Other countries
Australia, Argentina, South Africa, Mexico, Colombia and Brazil are the other countries where
GM HT cotton is grown commercially; from 2000 in Australia, 2001 in South Africa, 2002 in
Argentina, 2005 in Mexico, 2006 in Colombia and 2009 in Brazil. In 2014, 99% (210,000 ha), 100%
(412,000 ha), 100% (15,400 ha),89% (160,000 ha), 99% (29,840 ha) and 37% (380,000 ha) respectively
of the total Australian, Argentine, South African, Mexican, Colombian and Brazilian cotton crops
were planted to GM HT cultivars.
We are not aware of any published research into the impact of GM HT cotton in South Africa,
Argentina, Mexico or Colombia. In Australia, although research has been conducted into the
impact of using GM HT cotton (eg, Doyle et al (2003)) this does not provide quantification of the
impact 39. Drawing on industry source estimates 40, the main impacts have been:

becoming widely adopted from 2008 are higher (eg, $48/ha in 2012). Overall, in 2014, the
total farm income from using the technology was about $5.6 million and cumulatively,
since 2000, the total gains have been $91.5 million;
Argentina: no yield gain and an original cost of technology in the range of $30/ha to
$40/ha, although with the increasing availability of stacked traits in recent years, the
‘cost’ part of the HT technology has fallen to about $20/ha. Net farm income gains (after
deduction of the cost of the technology) have been $4/ha to $28/ha and in 2014 was $6/ha.
Overall, in 2014, the total farm income from using GM HT cotton technology was $16.7
million, and cumulatively since 2002, the farm income gain has been $145 million;
South Africa: no yield gain and a cost of technology in the range of $15/ha to $35/ha. Net
farm income gains from cost savings (after deduction of the cost of the technology) have
been $27/ha to $60/ha. In 2014, the average net gain was $34/ha and the total farm
income benefit of the technology was $0.53 million. Cumulatively since 2001, the total
farm income gain from GM HT cotton has been $4.2 million;
Mexico: average yield gains of +3.6% from improved weed control have been reported 41
in the first three years of use, no yield gain was recorded in 2008 and yield gains of +5.1%
in 2009, +18.1% in 2010 (since when Roundup Ready Flex technology has mainly been
used), +5.1% 2011, +13.1% 2012, +14.2% 2013 and +13.3% 2014. The average cost of the
technology has been in the range of $49/ha to $79/ha. The typical net farm income gains
were about $80/ha in the first two years of use, $16/ha in 2008 (when there was no yield
gain), $90/ha in 2009, $446/ha in 2010, $140/ha 2011, $290/ha 2012, $333/ha 2013 and
$330/ha in 2014. Overall, in 2014 the total farm income gain from using GM HT cotton
was $52.8 million and cumulatively since 2005, the total farm income gain has been
$183.2 million;
Colombia: average yield gain estimated at 4%, with a cost of technology at $168/ha in 2014
and herbicide cost savings of $194/ha. In 2014, this equates to a net increase in
profitability of $84/ha, which aggregated to the national level is an increase in farm
income of $2.5 million. Cumulatively since 2006, the total farm income gain has been $23
million;
Brazil: drawing on annual analysis by Galveo (2010-2014), the average yield gain has been
between 1.8% and 3.7%, although in 2012 a net yield loss of 1.8% was reported relative to
the best performing conventional seed. The technology fees (seed premium) have been
in a range of $37/ha to $52/ha and net cost savings (after deducting the technology fee)
have been between $36/ha and $90/ha. In 2014, the average farm income impact was
+$46/ha, which aggregated to the national level is equal to a farm income gain of $20.9
million. Cumulatively, since 2009, the technology has contributed a total of $133.3
million additional income to Brazilian cotton farmers.

3.4.3 Summary of global economic impact
Across the seven countries using GM HT cotton in 2014, the total farm income impact derived
from using GM HT cotton was +$146.5 million. Cumulatively since 1997, there have been net
farm income gains of $1.65 billion. Of this, 77% has been due to cost savings and 23% to yield
gains (from improved weed control relative to the level of weed control achieved using
conventional technology).

GM crop impact: 1996-2014

3.5 Herbicide tolerant canola
3.5.1 Canada
Canada was the first country to commercially use GM HT canola in 1996. Since then the area
planted to varieties containing GM HT traits has increased significantly, and in 2014 was 95% of
the total crop (7.92 million ha of GM HT crop).
The farm level impact of using GM HT canola in Canada since 1996 is summarised in Table 20.
The key features are as follows:
•

The primary impact in the early years of adoption was increased yields of almost 11%
(eg, in 2002 this yield increase was equivalent to an increase in total Canadian canola
production of nearly 7%). In addition, a small additional price premia was achieved
from crushers through supplying cleaner crops (lower levels of weed impurities). With
the development of hybrid varieties using conventional technology, the yield advantage
of GM HT canola relative to conventional alternatives 42 has been eroded. As a result, our
analysis has applied the yield advantage of +10.7%, associated with the GM HT
technology in its early years of adoption (source: Canola Council study of 2001), to 2003.
From 2004 the yield gain has been based on differences between average annual variety
trial results for ‘Clearfield’ (conventional herbicide tolerant varieties) and biotech
alternatives (see notes to table for details). The biotech alternatives have also been
differentiated into glyphosate tolerant and glufosinate tolerant. The quality premia
associated with cleaner crops (see above) has not been included in the analysis from 2004;
Cost of production (excluding the cost of the technology) has fallen, mainly through
reduced expenditure on herbicides and some savings in fuel and labour. These savings
have annually been between about $25/ha and $43/ha. The cost of the technology to 2003
was, however, marginally higher than these savings resulting in a net increase in costs of
$3/ha to $5/ha. On the basis of comparing GM HT canola with ‘Clearfield’ HT canola
(from 2004), there has, however been a net cost saving of $6/ha and $32/ha;
The overall impact on profitability (inclusive of yield improvements and higher quality)
has been an increase of between $21/ha and $48/ha, up to 2003. On the basis of
comparing GM HT canola with ‘Clearfield’ HT canola (from 2004), the net increase in
profitability has been between $23/ha and $74/ha;
The annual total national farm income benefit from using the technology has risen from
$6 million in 1996 to $569 million in 2014. The cumulative farm income benefit over the
1996-2014 period (in nominal terms) was $4.49 billion.

1. Impact data based on Canola Council study (2001) to 2003 and Gusta M et al (2009). Includes a
10.7% yield improvement and a 1.27% increase in the price premium earned (cleaner crop with
lower levels of weed impurities) until 2003. After 2004 the yield gain has been based on differences
between average annual variety trial results for ‘Clearfield’ and biotech alternatives. The biotech
alternatives have also been differentiated into glyphosate tolerant and glufosinate tolerant. This
resulted in; for GM glyphosate tolerant varieties no yield difference for 2004, 2005, 2008 and 2010,
+4% 2006 and 2007, +1.67% 2009, +1.6% 2011, +1.5% 2012, +3.1% 2013, +3.4% 2014. For GM
glufosinate tolerant varieties, the yield differences were +12% 2004 and 2008, +19% 2005, +10% 2006

3.5.2 The US
GM HT canola has been planted on a commercial basis in the US since 1999. In 2014, 95% of the
US canola crop was GM HT (597,720 ha).
The farm level impact has been similar to the impact identified in Canada. More specifically:
•

•

•

Average yields increased by about 6% in the initial years of adoption. As in Canada (see
section 3.5.1) the availability of high yielding hybrid conventional varieties has eroded
some of this yield gain relative to conventional alternatives. As a result, the positive
yield impacts post 2004 have been applied on the same basis as in Canada (comparison
with ‘Clearfield’: see section 3.5.1);
The cost of the technology has been $12/ha-$17/ha for glufosinate tolerant varieties and
$12/ha-$33/ha for glyphosate tolerant varieties. Cost savings (before inclusion of the
technology costs) have been $1/ha-$45/ha ($1/ha in 2014) for glufosinate tolerant canola
and $19-$79/ha for glyphosate tolerant canola;
The net impact on gross margins has been between +$22/ha and +$90/ha ($54/ha in 2014)
for glufosinate tolerant canola, and between +$23/ha and +$61/ha for glyphosate tolerant
canola ($23/ha in 2014);

At the national level the total farm income benefit in 2014 was $22.2 million (Figure 10)
and the cumulative benefit since 1999 has been $311.4 million.

Source and notes: Impact analysis based on Carpenter & Gianessi (2002), Sankala & Blumenthal (2003 &
2006), Johnson & Strom (2008) and updated from 2008 to reflect changes in herbicide prices and weed
control practices. Decrease in total farm income impact 2002-2004 is due to decline in total plantings of
canola in the US (from 612,000 in 2002 to 316,000 ha in 2004). Positive yield impact applied in the same way
as Canada from 2004 – see section 3.5.1

3.5.3 Australia
GM HT canola was first planted for commercial use in 2008. In 2014, GM HT canola was planted
on 350,000 ha. Almost all of these plantings had tolerance to the herbicide glyphosate, with a
very small area planted to varieties that were tolerant to glufosinate.
The main source of data on impact of this technology comes originally from a farm survey-based
analysis of impact of the glyphosate tolerant canola, commissioned by Monsanto amongst 92 of
the 108 farmers using this technology in 2008/09. Key findings from this survey were as follows:
•

The technology was made available in both open pollinated and hybrid varieties, with
the open pollinated varieties representing the cheaper end of the seed market, where
competition was mainly with open pollinated varieties containing herbicide tolerance
(derived conventionally) to herbicides in the triazine (TT) group. The hybrid varieties
containing glyphosate tolerance competed with non herbicide tolerant conventional
hybrid varieties and herbicide tolerant ‘Clearfield’ hybrids (tolerant to the imidazolinone
group of herbicides), although, where used in 2008, all of the 33 farmers in the survey
using GM HT hybrids did so mainly in competition and comparison with ‘Clearfield’
varieties;

•

The GM HT open pollinated varieties sold to farmers at a premium of about $Aus3/ha
(about $2.5 US/ha) relative to the TT varieties. The GM HT hybrids sold at a seed
premium of about $Aus 9/ha ($7.55 US/ha) compared to ‘Clearfield’ hybrids. In addition,
farmers using the GM HT technology paid a ‘technology’ fee in two parts; one part was a
set fee of $Aus500 per farm plus a second part based on output - $Aus 10.2/tonne of
output of canola. On the basis that there were 108 farmers using GM HT (glyphosate
tolerant) technology in 2008, the average ‘up front’ fee paid for the technology was
$Aus5.62/ha. On the basis of average yields obtained for the two main types of GM HT
seed used, those using open pollinated varieties paid Aus $11.83/ha (basis average yield
of 1.16 tonnes/ha) and those using GM HT hybrids paid $Aus12.95/ha (basis: average
yield of 1.27 tonnes/ha). Therefore, the total seed premium and technology fee paid by
farmers for the GM HT technology in 2008/09 was $Aus20.45/ha ($17.16 US/ha) for open
pollinated varieties and $Aus 27.57/ha ($23.13 US/ha) for hybrid varieties. After taking
into consideration the seed premium/technology fees, the GM HT system was marginally
more expensive by $Aus 3/ha ($2.5 US/ha) and Aus $4/ha (US $3.36/ha) respectively for
weed control than the TT and ‘Clearfield’ varieties;
The GM HT varieties delivered higher average yields than their conventional
counterparts: +22.11% compared to the TT varieties and +4.96% compared to the
‘Clearfield’ varieties. In addition, the GM HT varieties produced higher oil contents of
+2% and +1.8% respectively compared to TT and ‘Clearfield’ varieties;
The average reduction in weed control costs from using the GM HT system (excluding
seed premium/technology fee) was $Aus 17/ha for open pollinated varieties (competing
with TT varieties) and $Aus 24/ha for hybrids (competing with ‘Clearfield’ varieties).

In the analysis summarised in Table 21, we have applied these research findings to the total GM
HT crop area on a weighted basis in which the results of GM HT open pollinated varieties that
compete with TT varieties were applied to 64% of the total area in 2009 and 32% in 2010 and the
balance of area used the results from the GM HT hybrids competing with ‘Clearfield’ varieties.
This weighting reflects the distribution of farms in the survey. From 2011, yield differences
identified in Hudson D (2013) and Hudson D (2014) were used (a yield gain of about 14% relative
to open pollinated triazine tolerant varieties and a yield reduction of about 0.2% relative to
Clearfield hybrid canola again based on estimates of open pollination/hybrid seed sales). In
addition, the seed premia has been adjusted to reflect changes that have occurred post 2008
(mostly reflecting the end part royalty part of the premia that is yield dependant). Cost
differences between the different canola production systems were also updated from 2011 based
on the findings of Hudson (2013), Hudson (2014) and changes in herbicide prices. The findings
show an average farm income gain of US $45.6/ha and a total farm income gain of $15.96 million
in 2014. Cumulatively since 2008, the total farm income gain has been $55.8 million (Table 21).
It is noted that the share of GM HT canola has risen no higher than 13% of the total canola seed
market and this suggests that the economic performance of GM HT canola relative to some of the
mainstream alternative production systems and seed types is not offering sufficient enough
advantage to encourage wider take up of the technology. The recent analysis by Hudson (2013)
and Hudson (2014) provides insights into the impacts of the technology and shows that GM HT
canola offers greatest economic advantage relative to TT canola and where farmers are faced with
weeds that are resistant to a number of non-glyphosate herbicides (eg, annual ryegrass (Lolium
rigidum) and wild radish (Raphanus raphanistrum)). Relative to ‘Clearfield’ canola and
conventional canola (that contains no HT traits, whether GM- derived or not), GM HT canola is

reported to offer little yield gain and the cost savings associated with reduced herbicide costs
have tended to be more than offset by the cost of the technology. These factors may have been
one of the main reasons for changes in the pricing of the GM HT technology introduced in 2012
which resulted in some reduction in the total seed premia level.

3.5.4 Summary of global economic impact
In global terms, the farm level impact of using GM HT technology in canola in Canada, the US
and Australia was $607 million in 2014. Cumulatively since 1996, the farm income benefit has
been (in nominal terms) $4.86 billion. Within this, 74% has been due to yield gains and the
balance (26%) has been from cost savings.
In terms of the total value of canola production in these three countries in 2014, the additional
farm income generated by the technology is equal to a value added equivalent of 6.6%. Relative
to the value of global canola production in 2014, the farm income benefit added the equivalent of
1.8%.

3.6 GM herbicide tolerant (GM HT) sugar beet

3.6.1 US
GM HT sugar beet was first grown commercially in the US in 2007. In 2014, 454,780 hectares of
GM HT sugar beet were planted, equal to 98% of the total US crop.
Impact of the technology in 2007 and 2008 has been identified as follows:
a)

Yield: analysis by Kniss (2008) covering a limited number of farms in Wyoming (2007)
identified positive yield impacts of +8.8% in terms of additional root yield (from better
weed control) and +12.6% in terms of sugar content relative to conventional crops (ie, the

©PG Economics Ltd 2016

52

GM crop impact: 1996-2014

GM HT crop had about a 3.8% higher sugar content, which amounts to a 12.8% total
sucrose gain relative to conventional sugar beet once the root yield gain was taken into
consideration). In contrast, Khan (2008) found similar yields reported between
conventional and GM HT sugar beet in the Red River Valley region (North Dakota) and
Michigan. These contrasting results probably reflect a combination of factors including:
•

•

•

b)

The sugar beet growing regions in Wyoming can probably be classified as high weed
problem areas and, as such, are regions where obtaining effective weed control is
difficult using conventional technology (timing of application is key to weed control
in sugar beet, with optimal time for application being when weeds are small). Also
some weeds (eg, Kochia) are resistant to some of the commonly used ALS inhibitor
herbicides like chlorosulfuron. The availability of GM HT sugar beet with its greater
flexibility on application timing has therefore potentially delivered important yield
gains for such growers;
The GM HT trait was not available in all leading varieties suitable in all growing
regions in 2008, hence the yield benefits referred to above from better weed control
have to some extent been counterbalanced by only being available in poorer
performing germplasm in states like Michigan and North Dakota (notably not being
available in 2008 in leading varieties with rhizomania resistance). It should be noted
that the authors of the research cited in this section both perceive that yield benefits
from using GM HT sugar beet will be a common feature of the technology in most
regions once the technology is available in leading varieties;
2008 was reported to have been, in the leading sugar beet growing states, a
reasonable year for controlling weeds through conventional technology (ie, it was
possible to get good levels of weed control through timely applications), hence the
similar performance reported between the two systems.

Costs of production
• Kniss’s work in Wyoming identified weed control costs (comprising herbicides,
application, cultivation and hand labour) for conventional beet of $437/ha compared
to $84/ha for the GM HT system. After taking into consideration the $131/ha seed
premium/technology fee for the GM HT trait, the net cost differences between the
two systems was $222/ha in favour of the GM HT system. Kniss did, however,
acknowledge that the conventional costs associated with this sample were high
relative to most producers (reflecting application of maximum dose rates for
herbicides and use of hand labour), with a more typical range of conventional weed
control costs being between $171/ha and $319/ha (average $245/ha);
• Khan’s analysis puts the typical weed control costs in the Red River region of North
Dakota to be about $227/ha for conventional compared to $91/ha for GM HT sugar
beet. After taking into consideration the seed premium/technology fee (assumed by
Khan to be $158/ha 43 ), the total weed control costs were $249/ha for the GM HT
system, $22/ha higher than the conventional system. Despite this net increase in
average costs of production, most growers in this region used (and planned to
continue using), the GM HT system because of the convenience and weed control
flexibility benefits associated with it (which research by Marra and Piggot (2006): see
42F

43

Differences in the seed premium assumed by the different analysts reflect slightly different assumptions on seed rates used by
farmers (the technology premium being charged per bag of seed)

GM crop impact: 1996-2014

section 3.10, estimated in the corn, soybean and cotton sectors to be valued at
between $12/ha and $25/ha to US farmers). It is also likely that Khan’s analysis may
understate the total cost savings from using the technology by not taking into
account savings on application costs and labour for hand weeding.
For the purposes of our analysis we have drawn on both these pieces of work and sought to
update the impact assumptions based on experience post 2008. We are not aware of any
published yield impact studies. Discussions with independent sugar beet analysts and industry
representatives confirm that the early findings of research studies have been realised, with the
technology delivering important yield improvements in some regions (those with difficult to
control weeds, as identified by Kniss) but not so in other regions. The yield assumptions applied
in the analysis below (Table 22) therefore continue to be based on the findings of the original two
papers by Kniss and Khan. In relation to the seed premium and weed control costs, these have
been updated to reflect changes in seed prices/premia, herbicide usage patterns and herbicide
prices. This shows a net farm income gain in 2014 of $53.3 million to US sugar beet farmers
(average gain per hectare of $117.3/ha). Cumulatively, the farm income gain, since 2007 has been
$348 million.

Notes:
1. The yield gains identified by Kniss have been applied to the 2007 GM HT plantings in total and to
the estimated GM HT plantings in the states of Idaho, Wyoming, Nebraska and Colorado, where
penetration of plantings in 2008 was 85% (these states account for 26% of the total GM HT crop in
2008), and which are perceived to be regions of above average weed problems. For all other
regions, no yield gain is assumed. For 2008 onwards, this equates to a net average yield gain of
+2.79%, +3.21%, +3.21%, +3.19%, +3.27%, +3.12%, +3.2% respectively for 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012,
2013, 2014
2. The seed premium of $131/ha, average costs of weed control respectively for conventional and GM
HT systems of $245/ha and $84/ha, from Kniss, were applied to the crop in Idaho, Wyoming,
Nebraska and Colorado. The seed premium of $158/ha, weed control costs of $227/ha and $249/ha
respectively for conventional and GM HT sugar beet, identified by Khan, were applied to all other
regions using the technology. The resulting average values for seed premium/cost of technology
was $152.16/ha 2008 and $151.08/ha 2009 and 2010. Based on industry and extension service data
for 2011, a seed premium of $148/ha was used. The average weed control cost savings associated
with the GM HT system (before taking into consideration the seed premium) were $141.5/ha 2008
and $142.5/ha 2009 and 2010, $101.8/ha 2011 and 2012, $149.81/ha 2013, $154.22/ha 2014

3.6.2 Canada
GM HT sugar beet has also been used in the small Canadian sugar beet sector since 2008. In 2014,
96% of the total crop of 15,625 ha used this technology. We are not aware of any published
analysis of the impact of GM HT sugar beet in Canada, but if the same assumptions used in the
US are applied to Canada, the total farm income gain in 2014 was $1.69 million and cumulatively
since 2008, the income gain has been $8.59 million.

3.7 GM insect resistant 44 (GM IR) maize
43F

3.7.1 US
GM IR maize was first planted in the US in 1996 and in 2014 seed containing GM IR traits was
planted on 80% (26.91 million ha) of the total US maize crop.
The farm level impact of using GM IR maize in the US since 1996 is summarised in Table 23:
•

•

The primary impact has been increased average yields. Much of the analysis in early
years of adoption (summarised for example in Marra et al (2002) and James (2002))
identified an average yield impact of about +5%. More comprehensive and recent work
by Hutchison et al (2010) examined impacts over the 1996-2009 period and considered
the positive yield impact on non GM IR crops of ‘area-wide’ adoption of the technology.
The key finding of this work puts the average yield impact at +7%. This revised analysis
has been used as the basis for our analysis below. In 2014, this additional production is
equal to an increase in total US maize production of +7.9%;
The net impact on cost of production has been a small increase of between $1/ha and
$9/ha (additional cost of the technology being higher than the estimated average
insecticide cost savings of $15-$16/ha). In the last few years however, with the rising cost
of the technology 45, the net impact on costs has been an increase of $7/ha to $27/ha;
The annual total national farm income benefit from using the technology has risen from
$13.54 million in 1996 to $2.6 billion in 2014. The cumulative farm income benefit over
the 1996-2014 period (in nominal terms) was $21.1 billion.

3.7.2 Canada
GM IR maize has also been grown commercially in Canada since 1996. In 2014 it accounted for
84% of the total Canadian maize crop of 1.23 million ha. The impact of GM IR maize in Canada
has been very similar to the impact in the US (similar yield and cost of production impacts). At
the national level, this equates to additional farm income generated from the use of GM IR maize
of $89 million in 2014 (Figure 11) and cumulatively since 1996, additional farm income (in
nominal terms) of $906 million.

3.7.3 Argentina
In 2014, GM IR maize traits were planted on 73% of the total Argentine maize crop (GM IR
varieties were first planted in 1998).
The main impact of using the technology on farm profitability has been via yield increases.
Various studies (eg, see ISAAA review in James (2002)) have identified an average yield increase
in the region of 8% to 10%; hence an average of 9% has been used in the analysis up to 2004.
More recent trade source estimates provided to the authors put the average yield increase in the
last 4-5 years to be between 5% and 6%. Our analysis uses a yield increase value of 5.5% for the
years from 2004 (see also note relating to yield impact of stacked-traited seed in section 3.3.3: GM
HT maize in Argentina).
No savings in costs of production have arisen for most farmers because very few maize growers
in Argentina have traditionally used insecticides as a method of control for corn boring pests. As
such, average costs of production increased by $20/ha-$27/ha (the cost of the technology) in years
up to 2006. From 2007, with stacked-traited seed becoming available and widely used, the
additional cost of the technology relative to conventional seed has increased to about $28/ha$33/ha.
The net impact on farm profit margins (inclusive of the yield gain) has, in recent years, been an
increase of $3/ha to $36/ha. In 2014, the national level impact on profitability was an increase of
$87.8 million. Cumulatively, the farm income gain, since 1998 has been $678.3 million.

3.7.4 South Africa
GM IR maize has been grown commercially in South Africa since 2000. In 2014, 87% of the
country’s total maize crop of 3 million ha used GM IR cultivars.
The impact on farm profitability is summarised in Table 24. The main impact has been an
average yield improvement of between 5% and 32% in the years 2000-2004, with an average of
about 15% (used as the basis for analysis 2005-2007). In 2008 and 2009, the estimated yield impact
was +10.6% 46 (this has been used as the basis of the analysis for 2010 onwards). The cost of the
technology $8/ha to $17/ha has broadly been equal to the average cost savings from no longer
applying insecticides to control corn borer pests.
45F

At the national level, the increase in farm income in 2014 was $214.2 million and cumulatively
since 2000 it has been $1.71 billion. In terms of national maize production, the use of GM IR
technology has resulted in a net increase in national maize production of 9.2% in 2014.

3.7.5 Spain
Spain has been commercially growing GM IR maize since 1998 and in 2014, 32% (131,540 ha) of
the country’s maize crop was planted to varieties containing a GM IR trait.
As in the other countries planting GM IR maize, the main impact on farm profitability has been
increased yields (an average increase in yield of 6.3% across farms using the technology in the
early years of adoption). With the availability and widespread adoption of the Mon 810 trait
from 2003, the reported average positive yield impact is about +10% 47. There has also been a net
annual average saving on cost of production (from lower insecticide use) of between $37/ha and
$61/ha 48 (Table 25). This has been the basis of analysis to 2008 and from 2009 it draws on work by
Riesgo et al (2012). At the national level, these yield gains and cost savings have resulted in farm
income being boosted in 2014 by $26 million and cumulatively since 1998 the increase in farm
income (in nominal terms) has been $231.7 million.

3.7.8 Other countries
GM IR maize has been grown commercially in:
•

•

The Philippines since 2003. In 2014, 602,000 hectares out of total plantings of 2.6 million
(23%) were GM IR. Estimates of the impact of using GM IR (sources: Gonsales (2005),
Yorobe (2004) and Ramon (2005)) show annual average yield increases in the range of
14.3% to 34%. The mid point of this range (+24.15%) was used for the years 2003-2007.
For 2008 onwards a yield impact of +18% has been used based on Gonsales et al (2009).
Based on the findings of these research papers, a small average annual insecticide cost
saving of about $12/ha-$15/ha and average cost of the technology of $30/ha-$47/ha have
been used. The net impact on farm profitability has been between $37/ha and $118/ha.
In 2014, the national farm income benefit derived from using the technology was $70.85
million and cumulative farm income gain since 2003 has been $418.3 million;
Uruguay since 2004, and in 2014, 76,330 ha (92% of the total crop) were GM IR. Using
Argentine data as the basis for assessing impact, the cumulative farm income gain has
been $24.8 million;

Honduras. Here farm ‘trials’ have been permitted since 2003, and in 2014, an estimated
29,000 ha used GM IR traits. Evidence from Falck Zepeda et al (2009) indicated that the
primary impact of the technology has been to increase average yields (in 2008 +24%). As
insecticides have not traditionally been used by most farmers, no costs of production
savings have arisen. For the seed premium, no premia was charged during the trials
period for growing (2003-2006), though for the purposes of our analysis, a seed premium
of $30/ha was assumed. From 2006, the seed premium applied is based on Falck-Zepeda
et al (2009) at $100/ha. Based on these costs, the estimated farm income benefit derived
from the technology in 2014 was $1 million and cumulatively since 2003 the income gain
has been $9.6 million;
Colombia. GM IR maize has been grown on a ‘trial basis’ since 2007 in Colombia. In
2014, seed containing this technology was used on 14% of the crop (66,820 ha). Based on
analysis from Mendez et al (2011) which explored impacts in one small region (San Juan
valley), the average yield gain was +22%, the seed premium about $47/ha and the
savings in insecticide use equal to about $53/ha (ie, a net cost saving of about $6/ha).
Inclusive of the yield gain, the average farm income gain in 2014 was about $266/ha. If
aggregated to the whole of the GM IR area in 2014, this equates to a net farm income
gain of $17.75 million. Cumulatively since 2007, the net farm income gain has been
about $82.5 million;
Paraguay. The first commercial crop of maize using this technology was grown in 201314. In 2014-15, 50% of the total crop (500,000 ha) used seed containing this technology.
Applying impact analysis from Argentina (in terms of average yield impacts and
insecticide saving assumptions), together with a seed premium of about $20/ha (source:
Monsanto Paraguay), the average farm income gain from using the technology in 2014
was +$9.7ha. At the national level, this is equivalent to a total farm income gain of $4.85
million in 2014 and over the two years, the total farm income benefit has been $13.1
million.

3.7.9 Summary of economic impact
In global terms, the farm level impact of using GM IR maize was $3.8 billion in 2014.
Cumulatively since 1996, the benefit has been (in nominal terms) $29.95 billion. This farm income
gain has mostly derived from improved yields (less pest damage) although in some countries
farmers have derived a net cost saving associated with reduced expenditure on insecticides.
In terms of the total value of maize production from the countries growing GM IR maize in 2014,
the additional farm income generated by the technology is equal to a value added equivalent of
4.4%. Relative to the value of global maize production in 2014, the farm income benefit added the
equivalent of 2.3%.

3.8 Insect resistant (Bt) cotton (GM IR)
3.8.1 The US
GM IR cotton has been grown commercially in the US since 1996, and in 2014 was used on 84%
(3.11 million ha) of total cotton plantings.

©PG Economics Ltd 2016

61

GM crop impact: 1996-2014

The farm income impact of using GM IR cotton is summarised in Table 28. The primary benefit
has been increased yields (by 9%-11%), although small net savings in costs of production have
also been obtained (reduced expenditure on insecticides being marginally greater than the cost of
the technology for Bollgard I). Overall, average profitability levels increased by $53/ha-$115/ha
with Bollgard I cotton (with a single Bt gene) between 1996 and 2002 and by between $87/ha and
$151/ha in 2003-2014 with Bollgard II (containing two Bt genes and offering a broader spectrum
of control). This resulted in a net gain to farm income in 2014 of $402.6 million. Cumulatively,
since 1996 the farm income benefit has been $4.75 billion.

3.8.2 China
China first planted GM IR cotton in 1997, since when the area planted to GM IR varieties has
increased to 93% of the total 4.4 million ha crop in 2014.
As in the US, a major farm income impact has been via higher yields of +8% to +10% on the crops
using the technology, although there have also been significant cost savings on insecticides used
and the labour previously used to undertake spraying. Overall, annual average costs have fallen
(eg, by $80/ha-$90/ha in the last 3 years) and coupled with the yield gains, net returns have
increased significantly. In 2014, the average increase in profitability was +$319/ha, which equates

to a net national gain of $1.31 billion (Table 29). Cumulatively since 1997 the farm income benefit
has been $17.54 billion.

IR traits (Australia first planted commercial GM IR cotton in 1996).
Unlike the other main countries using GM IR cotton, Australian growers have rarely derived
yield gains from using the technology (reflecting the effective use of insecticides for pest control
prior to the availability of GM IR cultivars); with the primary farm income benefit being derived
from lower costs of production (Table 30). More specifically:
•

In the first two years of adoption of the technology (Ingard, single gene Bt cotton), small
net income losses were derived, mainly because of the relatively high price charged for
the seed. Since this price was lowered in 1998, the net income impact has been positive,

with cost savings of between $54/ha and $90/ha, mostly derived from lower insecticide
costs (including application) more than offsetting the cost of the technology;
For the last few years of use, Bollgard II cotton (containing two Bt genes) has been
available offering effective control of a broader range of cotton pests. Despite the higher
costs of this technology, users have continued to make significant net cost savings of
$186/ha to $270/ha;
At the national level in 2014, the net farm income gain was $44.7 million and
cumulatively since 1996 the gains have been $801.7 million.

3.8.4 Argentina
GM IR cotton has been planted in Argentina since 1998. In 2014, it accounted for 88% of total
cotton plantings.
The main impact in Argentina has been yield gains of 30%. This has more than offset the cost of
using the technology 49. In terms of gross margin, cotton farmers have gained between $25/ha
and $317/ha annually during the period 1998-2014 50. At the national level, the farm income gain
was $114.8 million (Figure 12). Cumulatively since 1998, the farm income gain from use of the
technology has been $803 million.

3.8.5 Mexico
GM IR cotton has been planted commercially in Mexico since 1996. In 2014, GM IR cotton was
planted on 99,870 ha (55% of total cotton plantings).
The main farm income impact of using the technology has been yield improvements of between
7% and 16% over the last five years. In addition, there have been important savings in the cost of
production (lower insecticide costs) 51. Overall, the annual net increase in farm profitability has
been within the range of $104/ha and $378/ha (Table 31). At the national level, the farm income
benefit in 2014 was $37.8 million and the impact on total cotton production was an increase of
8.7%. Cumulatively since 1996, the farm income benefit has been $194.3 million.

3.8.6 South Africa
In 2014, GM IR cotton 52 was planted on all of the 15,400 ha cotton crop in South Africa.
51F

The main impact on farm income has been significantly higher yields (an annual average increase
of about 24%). In terms of cost of production, the additional cost of the technology (between
$17/ha and $24/ha for Bollgard I and $30/ha to $50/ha for Bollgard II (2006 onwards)) has been
greater than the insecticide cost and labour (for water collection and spraying) savings ($12/ha to
$23/ha), resulting in an increase in overall cost of production of $2/ha to $32/ha. Combining the
positive yield effect and the increase in cost of production, the net effect on profitability has been
an annual increase of between $27/ha and $507/ha.
At the national level, farm incomes over the last five years have annually increased by between
$0.5 million and $3.9 million (Figure 13). Cumulatively since 1998, the farm income benefit has
been $30.9 million.

4. The decline in the total farm income benefit 2004 and 2005 relative to earlier years reflects the
decline in total cotton plantings. This was caused by relatively low farm level prices for cotton in
2004 and 2005 (reflecting a combination of relatively low world prices and a strong South African
currency)

3.8.7 India
GM IR cotton has been planted commercially in India since 2002. In 2014, 11.7 million ha were
planted to GM IR cotton which is equal to 92% of total plantings.
The main impact of using GM IR cotton has been major increases in yield 53. With respect to cost
of production, the average cost of the technology (seed premium: $49/ha to $54/ha) up to 2006
was greater than the average insecticide cost savings of $31/ha-$58/ha resulting in a net increase
in costs of production. Following the reduction in the seed premium in 2006 to $13/ha-$20/ha,
farmers have made a net cost saving of $17/ha-$25/ha. Coupled with the yield gains, important
net gains to levels of profitability have been achieved of between $82/ha and $356/ha. At the
national level, the farm income gain in 2014 was $1.6 billion and cumulatively since 2002 the farm
income gains have been $18.3 billion (Table 32).

Bennett et al (2004) found average yield increases of 45% in 2002 and 63% in 2003 (average over the two years of 54%) relative to
conventionally produced cotton. Survey data from Monsanto (2005) confirmed this high yield impact (+58% reported in 2004) and
from IMRB (2006) which found an average yield increase of 64% in 2005 & IMRB (2007) which found a yield impact of +50% in
2006. Later work by Gruere (2008), Qaim (2009) and Herring and Rao (2012) have all confirmed significant yield increases in the
range of +30% to +40%

The impact on total cotton production was an increase of 22.1% in 2014.

3.8.8 Brazil
GM IR cotton was planted commercially in Brazil for the first time in 2006, and in 2014 was
planted on 330,000 ha (32% of the total crop). The area planted to GM IR cotton in Brazil has
fluctuated (eg, 358,000 ha in 2007 and 116,000 ha in 2009) largely due to the performance of the
seed containing the GM IR trait compared to leading conventional varieties. In 2006, on the basis
of industry estimates of impact of GM IR cotton relative to similar varieties (average yield gain of
+6% and a net cost saving from reduced expenditure on insecticides after deduction of the
premium paid for using the technology of about +$25/ha), a net farm income gain of about
$125/ha was realised. Since then, however, improved conventional varieties in which the GM IR
trait is not present have dominated production because of their superior yields. As a result,
varieties containing the GM IR trait have delivered inferior yields (despite offering effective
control against bollworm pests) relative to the leading conventional varieties. In addition, boll
weevil is a major pest in many cotton growing areas, a pest that the GM IR technology does not
target. Analysis by Galvao (2009 & 2010) estimated that the yield performance of the varieties
containing GM IR traits was lower (by –2.7% to -3.8%) than the leading conventional alternatives
available in 2007-2009. As a result, the average impact on farm income (after taking into
consideration insecticide cost savings and the seed premium) has been negative (-$34.5/ha in
2007, a small net gain of about $2/ha in 2008 and a net loss of -$44/ha in 2009). Not surprisingly,
at the country level, this resulted in net aggregate losses in 2007 and 2009 from using the
technology (eg, -$5 million in 2009). In 2010, stacked traits (containing GM HT and GM IR traits)
became available in some of the leading varieties for the first time and this has contributed to the
increase in plantings since 2010. Annual estimates of the impact of this technology (Galvao (20102014)) found average yield impacts of zero in 2010, +3% in 2011, -1.8% in 2012 and +2.4% 2013 and
2014 relative to the best performing conventional varieties. Based on these yield finding, seed

premia of $42.54/ha 2010, $52.3/ha 2011, $34.08/ha 2012, $30.9/ha 2013, $44/ha 2014, and
insecticide cost savings of $58.94/ha 2010, $42.7/ha 2011, $41.4/ha 2012, $37.5/ha 2013 and $58.7/ha
2014, the net impact from using the GM IR technology was +$91.3/ha in 2014. At the national
level this equates to a net income gain of $30.1 million. Cumulatively, since 2006 GM IR
technology has delivered an aggregate net farm income gain of $72.7 million.

3.8.9 Other countries

Colombia. GM IR cotton has been grown commercially in Colombia since 2002 (28,640 ha
planted in 2014 out of a total cotton crop of 30,000 ha). Drawing on recent analysis of impact
by Zambrano et al (2009), the main impact has been a significant improvement in yield
(+32%). On the cost side, this analysis shows that GM IR cotton farmers tend to have
substantially higher expenditures on pest control than their conventional counterparts which,
when taking into consideration the approximate $70/ha cost of the technology, results in a net
addition to costs of between $200/ha and $280/ha (relative to typical expenditures by
conventional cotton growers). Nevertheless, after taking into consideration the positive yield
effects, the net impact on profitability has been positive. In 2008, the average improvement in
profitability was about $90/ha and the total net gain from using the technology was $1.8
million 54. Since the Zambrano work, the use of GM IR cotton has seen problems with
reduced yield benefits in 2009 due mainly to heavy rains in the planting season delaying
planting, followed by lack of rain in the growing season and the increasing availability of
stacked traited seed. For the purposes of this analysis, from 2010 estimates of impact are
based on industry source data which were a net yield benefit of +10%, seed premium of
$157/ha-$171/ha and insecticide cost savings of $80/ha to $87/ha. As a result, the net farm
income benefit in 2014 was estimated to be +$66/ha. At the national level, this equated to a
net farm income gain of $1.9 million. Cumulatively, since 2002 the net farm income gain was
$19 million;
Burkina Faso: GM IR cotton was first grown commercially in 2008. In 2014, GM IR cotton
accounted for 70% (454,000 ha) of total plantings. Based on analysis by Vitale et al (2006, 2008
and 2009), the main impact of the technology is improved yields (by +18% to +20%) and
savings in insecticide expenditure of about $52/ha. Based on a cost of technology of $53/ha,
the net impact on cost of production is marginally negative, but inclusive of the yield gains,
the net income gain in 2014 was $89/ha. The total aggregate farm income gain, in 2014 was
$40.6 million and cumulatively, since 2008, it has been $177.6 million;
Pakistan: After widespread ‘illegal’ planting of GM IR cotton in Pakistan for several years, it
was officially permitted in 2009 and in 2014, 89% of the crop (2.6 million ha) used this
technology. Initial analysis of the impact draws on Nazli et al (2010) which identified an
average yield gain of +12.6%, seed premium of about $14/ha-$15/ha and an average
insecticide cost saving of about $20/ha. Based on this analysis (undertaken during a period
when unofficial and largely illegal seed was used), the average farm income benefit in 2009
was $37/ha. Subsequent analysis by Kouser and Qaim (2013) has formed the basis of our
estimates for impacts from 2010. This is based on a yield benefit of +22%, a technology (seed)
premium of about $4-$5/ha and crop protection savings of $10-$12/ha. For 2014, the

Given that the Zambrano et al work identified important differences between the baseline level of insecticide use by GM IR cotton
users and conventional cotton farmers (pre-adoption of the technology), this probably understates the cost savings associated with the
technology. A more representative assessment of the impact compares the costs (post adoption) of GM IR technology users with the
likely costs of reverting back to conventional technology on these farms

estimated average farm income benefit was $113/ha. At the national level this is equal to a
net farm income gain of $298.9 million. Cumulatively since 2009, the farm income benefit of
using this technology is $1.95 billion;
Myanmar: GM IR cotton has been grown in Myanmar since 2007 and in 2014, 318,000 ha (88%
of the total crop) used seed containing the trait. Data on the impact of the technology in
Myanmar is limited, with the brief report from the USDA (2011) being the only one
identified. This indicated that the technology has been used exclusively in ‘long staple’
varieties and was delivering up to a 70% improvement in yield (source: extension advisors).
Given ‘long staple’ varieties account for only a part of the total crop, our analysis uses a more
conservative average yield of +30% and applies this only to the ‘long staple’ area (estimates
thereof). In addition, due to the lack of data on seed premia and cost savings (relating to
labour and insecticide use), we have used data based on costs and impacts from India. Based
on these assumptions, the average income gain in 2014 was $115/ha, which at the national
level amounts to a gain of $36.6 million. Cumulatively the farm income gain since 2007 has
been $185 million;
Sudan and Paraguay: These countries have respectively been using GM IR cotton since 2012
and 2013. No detailed impact analysis has been identified for the technology in these
countries.

3.8.10 Summary of global impact
In global terms, the farm level impact of using GM IR cotton was $3.94 billion in 2014.
Cumulatively since 1996, the farm income benefit has been (in nominal terms) $44.83 billion.
Within this, 78% of the farm income gain has derived from yield gains (less pest damage) and the
balance (22%) from reduced expenditure on crop protection (spraying of insecticides).
In terms of the total value of cotton production from the countries growing GM IR in 2014, the
additional farm income generated by the technology is equal to a value added equivalent of
12.5%. Relative to the value of global cotton production in 2014, the farm income benefit added
the equivalent of 8.9%.

3.9 Other GM crops
3.9.1 Maize/corn rootworm resistance
GM IR (resistant to corn rootworm (CRW)) maize has been planted commercially in the US since
2003. In 2014, there were 18.7 million ha of GM IR CRW maize (56% of the total US crop).
The main farm income impact 55 has been higher yields of about 5% relative to conventional
maize. The impact on average costs of production has been +$2/ha to +$12/ha (based on an
average cost of the technology of $25/ha-$42/ha and an insecticide cost saving of $23/ha-$37/ha 56).
As a result, the net impact on farm profitability has been +$24/ha to +$102/ha.

The average area on which the insecticide cost savings have been applied has been limited to the historic area typically treated with
insecticides for rootworm pests (about 40% of the total crop). In addition, from 2012, the area on which this saving has been applied
has been reduced to reflect increased spraying with insecticides that target rootworm pests by some farmers who perceive they may
have problems with rootworm developing resistance to the IR technology

GM crop impact: 1996-2014

At the national level, farm incomes increased by $1.44 billion in 2014. Cumulatively since 2003,
the total farm income gain from the use of GM IR CRW technology in the US maize crop has been
+$11.13 billion.
GM IR CRW cultivars were also planted commercially for the first time in 2004 in Canada. In
2014, the area planted to CRW resistant varieties was 0.73 million ha. Based on US costs,
insecticide cost savings and yield impacts, this has resulted in additional income at the national
level of $55.6 million in 2014 (cumulative total since 2004 of $323.3 million).
At the global level, the extra farm income derived from GM IR CRW maize use has been $11.45
billion.

3.9.2 Virus resistant papaya
Ringspot resistant papaya has been commercially grown in the US (State of Hawaii) since 1999,
and in 2014, 75% of the state’s papaya crop was GM virus resistant (455 ha of fruit bearing trees).
The main farm income impact of this technology has been to significantly increase yields relative
to conventional varieties. Compared to the average yield in the last year before the first biotech
cultivation (1998), the annual average yield increase of biotech papaya relative to conventional
crops has been within a range of +15% to +77% (17% in 2014). At a state level, this was equivalent
to a 12.75% increase in total papaya production.
In terms of profitability 57, the net annual impact has been an improvement of between $2,400/ha
and $11,400/ha, and in 2014, this amounted to a net farm income gain of $3,619/ha and an
aggregate benefit across the state of $1.65 million. Cumulatively, the farm income benefit since
1999 has been $26.5 million.

Virus resistant papaya are also reported to have been grown in China, (8,475 ha in 2014). No
impact data on this technology has been identified.

3.9.3 Virus resistant squash
GM virus resistant squash has also been grown in some states of the US since 2004. It is
estimated to have been planted on 2,000 ha in 2014 58 (13% of the total crop).
57F

Based on analysis from Johnson & Strom (2008), the primary farm income impact of using GM
virus resistant squash has been derived from higher yields which in 2014, added a net gain to
users of $23.1 million. Cumulatively, the farm income benefit since 2004 has been $269.3 million.

3.9.4 Other crops
a) Potatoes
GM IR potatoes were grown commercially in the US between 1996 and 2000 (planted on 4% of
the total US potato crop in 1999 (30,000 ha)). This technology was withdrawn in 2001 when the

technology provider (Monsanto) withdrew from the market to concentrate on GM trait
development in maize, soybeans, cotton and canola. This commercial decision was also probably
influenced by the decision of some leading potato processors and fast food outlets to stop using
GM potatoes because of perceived concerns about this issue from some of their consumers, even
though the GM potato provided the producer and processor with a lower cost, higher yielding
and more consistent product. It also delivered significant reductions in insecticide use
(Carpenter & Gianessi (2002)).
High starch potatoes were also approved for planting in the EU in 2010 and a small area was
planted in member states such as Sweden, the Czech Republic and Germany until the technology
provider withdrew the product from the market in 2012. There is no data available on the impact
of this technology.
b) Alfalfa
GM HT alfalfa was first commercialised in the US in 2007 on about 100,000 ha. However,
between 2008 and 2010, it was not allowed to be planted due to legal action requiring the
completion of additional environmental impact assessments. This was completed by 2010 and
commercial use of the technology allowed to be resumed in 2011. Approximately 1.3 million ha
of GM alfalfa were being cropped in 2014. The technology is reported to offer improved weed
control, better yields and higher quality forage. No analysis is presented here due to the lack of
published studies on the impact.

3.10 Indirect (non pecuniary) farm level economic impacts
As well as the tangible and quantifiable impacts identified and analysed on farm profitability
presented above, there are other important impacts of an economic nature. These include
impacts on a broader range of topics such as labour use, households and local communities. The
literature on these impacts is developing and a full examination of these impacts potentially
merits a study in its own right. These issues are not examined in depth in this work as to do so
would add considerably to an, already, long report. As such, this section provides only a
summary of some of the most important additional, and mostly intangible, difficult to quantify,
impacts.
Many of the impact studies 59 cited in this report have identified the following reasons as being
important influences for adoption of the technology:
58F

Herbicide tolerant crops
• Increased management flexibility and convenience that comes from a combination of the
ease of use associated with broad-spectrum, post emergent herbicides like glyphosate
and the increased/longer time window for spraying. This not only frees up management
time for other farming activities but also allows additional scope for undertaking offfarm, income earning activities;
• In a conventional crop, post-emergent weed control relies on herbicide applications after
the weeds and crop are established. As a result, the crop may suffer ‘knock-back’ to its

growth from the effects of the herbicide. In the GM HT crop, this problem is avoided
because the crop is tolerant to the herbicide;
Facilitates the adoption of conservation or no tillage systems. This provides for
additional cost savings such as reduced labour and fuel costs associated with ploughing,
additional moisture retention and reductions in levels of soil erosion;
Improved weed control has contributed to reduced harvesting costs – cleaner crops have
resulted in reduced times for harvesting and improved harvest quality which in some
cases has led to price bonuses;
Elimination of potential damage caused by soil-incorporated residual herbicides in
follow-on crops (eg, TT canola in Australia) and less need to apply herbicides in a followon crop because of the improved levels of weed control;
A contribution to the general improvement in human safety (as manifest in greater peace
of mind about own and worker safety) from a switch to more environmentally benign
products.

Insect resistant crops
• Production risk management/insurance purposes – the technology takes away much of
the worry of significant pest damage occurring and is, therefore, highly valued;
• A ‘convenience’ benefit derived from having to devote less time to crop walking and/or
applying insecticides;
• Savings in energy use – mainly associated with less use of aerial spraying;
• Savings in machinery use (for spraying and possibly reduced harvesting times);
• Higher quality of crop. There is a growing body of research evidence relating to the
superior quality of GM IR corn relative to conventional and organic corn from the
perspective of having lower levels of mycotoxins;
• Improved health and safety for farmers and farm workers (from reduced handling and
use of pesticides, especially in developing countries where many apply pesticides with
little or no use of protective clothing and equipment);
• Shorter growing season (eg, for some cotton growers in India) which allows some
farmers to plant a second crop in the same season 60. Also some Indian cotton growers
have reported knock on benefits for bee keepers as fewer bees are now lost to insecticide
spraying.
59 F

Since the early 2000s, a number of farmer-survey based studies in the US have also attempted to
better quantify these non pecuniary benefits. These studies have usually employed contingent
valuation techniques 61 to obtain farmers’ valuations of non pecuniary benefits. A summary of
these findings is shown in Table 33.

Aggregating the impact to US crops 1996-2014
The approach used to estimate the non pecuniary benefits derived by US farmers from biotech
crops over the period 1996-2014 has been to draw on the values identified by Marra and Piggot
(2006 & 2007: Table 33) and to apply these to the GM crop planted areas during this 19 year
period.
Figure 14 summarises the values for non pecuniary benefits derived from GM crops in the US
and shows an estimated (nominal value) benefit of $1.17 billion in 2014 and a cumulative total
benefit (1996-2014) of $12.3 billion. Relative to the value of direct farm income benefits presented
above, the non pecuniary benefits were equal to 13.5% of the total direct income benefits in 2014
and 18.6% of the total cumulative (1996-2014) direct farm income. This highlights the important
contribution this category of benefit has had on biotech trait adoption levels in the US, especially
where the direct farm income benefits have been identified to be relatively small (eg, HT cotton).
Figure 14: Non pecuniary benefits derived by US farmers 1996-2014 by trait ($ million)

Estimating the impact in other countries
It is evident from the literature review that GM technology-using farmers in other countries also
value the technology for a variety of non pecuniary/intangible reasons. The most appropriate
methodology for identifying these non pecuniary benefit valuations in other countries would be
to repeat the type of US farmer-surveys in other countries. Unfortunately, the authors are not
aware of any such studies having been undertaken to date.

3.11 Production effects of the technology
Based on the yield assumptions used in the direct farm income benefit calculations presented
above (see Appendix 1) and taking into account the second soybean crop facilitation in South
America, GM crops have added important volumes to global production of maize, cotton, canola
and soybeans (Table 34).

The GM IR traits, used in maize and cotton, have accounted for 95% of the additional maize
production and 99.2% of the additional cotton production. Positive yield impacts from the use of
this technology have occurred in all user countries (except for GM IR cotton in Australia 62) when
compared to average yields derived from crops using conventional technology (such as
application of insecticides and seed treatments). The average yield impact across the total area
planted to these traits over the 19 years since 1996 has been +13.1% for maize and +17.3% for
cotton (Table 35).
61F

As indicated earlier, the primary impact of GM HT technology has been to provide more cost
effective (less expensive) and easier weed control, as opposed to improving yields. The
improved weed control has, nevertheless, delivered higher yields in some countries. The main
source of additional production from this technology has been via the facilitation of no tillage
production systems shortening the production cycle, and how it has enabled many farmers in
South America to plant a crop of soybeans immediately after a wheat crop in the same growing
season. This second crop, additional to traditional soybean production, has added 135.7 million
tonnes to soybean production in Argentina and Paraguay between 1996 and 2014 (accounting for
85.7% of the total GM-related additional soybean production).

3.12 Trade flows and related issues
a) Share of global exports
Looking at the extent to which the leading GM producing countries are traders (exporters) of
these crops and key derivatives (Table 36 and Table 37) show the following:
•

Soybeans: in 2014/15, 40% of global production was exported and 97.8% of this trade came
from countries which grow GM soybeans. As there has been some development of a
market for certified conventional soybeans and derivatives (mostly in the EU, Japan and
South Korea), this has necessitated some segregation of (certified) non GM/conventional
exports from supplies that may contain GM origin material, or sourcing from countries
where GM HT soybeans are not grown. Based on estimates of the size of the certified
non GM/conventional soy markets in the EU and SE Asia (the main markets) 63, between
2.4% and 3% of global trade in soybeans is probably required to be certified as
conventional. A similar pattern occurs in soymeal, where 89% of globally traded meal
probably contains GM material;
Maize: 13% of global production was internationally traded in 2014/15 64. Within the
leading exporting nations, the GM maize growers of the US, Argentina, Brazil, South
Africa and Canada are important players (% of global trade). As there has been some
limited development of a distinct market which requires certified conventional maize
(mostly in the EU, Japan and South Korea), this has necessitated some segregation of
exports into GM versus certified conventional supplies. The likely share of global trade
accounted for by GM maize exports is 65%-71%;
Cotton: in 2014/15, 30% of global production was traded internationally. Of the leading
exporting nations, the GM cotton growing countries of the US, Australia, India, Pakistan,
Brazil and Burkina Faso are prominent exporters accounting for 67% of global trade.
Given that the market for certified conventional cotton is very small, virtually all of this
share of global cotton trade from GM cotton growing countries is probably not subject to
any form of segregation and hence may contain GM derived material 65. In terms of
cottonseed-meal the GM share of global trade is 50%;
Canola: 21% of global canola production in 2014/15 was exported, with Canada being the
main global trading country. The share of global canola exports accounted for by the
three GM HT canola producing countries (Canada, the US and Australia) was 68% in
2014/15. As there has been only a very small development of a market for certified
conventional canola globally (the EU, the main market where certified conventional

4 The environmental impact of GM crops
This section examines the environmental impact of using GM crops over the last nineteen years.
The two key aspects of environmental impact explored are:
a.
b.

Impact on insecticide and herbicide use.
Impact on carbon emissions.

These are presented in the sub-sections below.

4.1 Use of insecticides and herbicides
Assessment of the impact of GM crops on insecticide and herbicide use requires comparisons of
the respective weed and pest control measures used on GM versus the ‘conventional alternative’
form of production. This presents a number of challenges relating to availability and
representativeness.
Comparison data ideally derives from farm level surveys which collect usage data on the
different forms of production. A search of the literature on insecticide or herbicide use change
with GM crops shows that the number of studies exploring these issues is limited with even
fewer providing data to the pesticide (active ingredient) level. Secondly, national level pesticide
usage survey data is also extremely limited; there are no published, detailed, annual pesticide
usage surveys conducted by national authorities in any of the countries currently growing GM
crop traits. The only country in which pesticide usage data is collected (by private market
research companies) on an annual basis, and which allows a comparison between GM and
conventional crops to be made, is the US 66.
65F

Even where national pesticide use survey data is available, it has limitations. A reasonable
estimate of the amount of herbicide or insecticide usage changes that have occurred with GM
crop technology, requires an assessment of what herbicides/insecticides might reasonably be
expected to be used in the absence of crop biotechnology on the relevant crops (ie, if the entire
crops used non GM production methods). Applying usage rates for the current (remaining)
conventional crops is one approach. However, if this conventional cropping data set relates to a
relatively small share of total crop area (as it does in the case of a number of crops and countries
where GM technology has been adopted), it will likely produce biased and unrepresentative
information about the levels of herbicide or insecticide use that might reasonably be expected
across the whole crop in the absence of GM technology because:
•

Whilst the degree of pest/weed problems/damage vary by year, region and within region,
farmers who continue to farm conventionally may be those with relatively low levels of
pest/weed problems, and hence see little, if any, economic benefit from using the GM
traits targeted at minimal pest/weed problems. Their insecticide/herbicide usage levels
therefore tend to be below the levels that would reasonably be expected on an average
farm with more typical pest/weed infestations;

66

The US Department of Agriculture also conducts pesticide usage surveys but these are not conducted on an annual basis (eg, the last
time maize was included was 2010 and previous to this in 2005) and do not disaggregate usage by production type (GM versus
conventional)

GM crop impact: 1996-2014

•

•

•

Some of the farms continuing to use conventional seed generally use extensive, low
intensity production methods (including organic) which feature limited (below average)
use of herbicides/insecticides. The usage patterns of this sub-set of growers is therefore
likely to understate usage for the majority of farmers if they all returned to farming
without the use of GM technology;
The widespread adoption of GM IR technology has resulted in ‘area-wide’ suppression of
target pests such as stalk borers in maize crops. As a result, conventional farmers (eg, of
maize in the US) have benefited from this lower level of pest infestation and the
associated reduced need to conduct insecticide treatments;
Some of the farmers using GM traits have experienced improvements in pest/weed
control from using this technology relative to the conventional control methods
previously used. If these farmers were to now revert to using conventional techniques, it
is likely that most would wish to maintain the levels of pest/weed control delivered with
use of the GM traits and therefore some would use higher levels of insecticide/herbicide
than they did in the pre GM crop days. This argument can, however, be countered by the
constraining influence on farm level pesticide usage that comes from the cost of
pesticides and their application. Ultimately the decision to use more pesticide or not
would be made at the farm level according to individual assessment of the potential
benefits (from higher yields) compared to the cost of additional pesticide use.

This problem of bias and poor representativeness of pesticide usage data obtained from a small
conventional data set (for what might reasonably be considered as the ‘conventional alternative’
if GM technology was not available) has been addressed in this report in the following ways:
•

•

Firstly, by using the average recorded values for insecticide/herbicide usage on
conventional crops for years only when the conventional crop accounted for the majority
(50% or more) of the total crop and;
Secondly, in other years (eg, from 1999 for soybeans, from 2001 for cotton and from 2007
for maize in the US) applying estimates of the likely usage if the whole US crop was no
longer using crop biotechnology, based on opinion from extension and industry advisors
across the US as to what farmers might reasonably be expected to use in terms of weed
control practices and usage levels of insecticide/herbicide. In addition, the usage levels
identified from this methodology were cross checked (and subject to adjustment) against
historic average usage levels of key herbicide and insecticide active ingredients from the
private market research data set so as to minimise the scope for understating or
overstating likely usage levels on the conventional alternative.

Overall, this approach has been applied in other countries where pesticide usage data is
available, though more commonly, because of the paucity of available data, the analysis relies
more on extension/advisor opinion and knowledge of actual and potential pesticide use.
This methodology has been used by others. It also has the advantage of providing comparisons
of current crop protection practices on both GM crops and the conventional alternatives, so takes
into account dynamic changes in crop protection management practices and technologies, rather
than making comparisons solely on past practices. Details of how this methodology has been
applied to the 2014 calculations, sources used for each trait/country combination examined and
examples of typical conventional versus GM pesticide applications are provided in Appendix 3.

GM crop impact: 1996-2014

The most common way in which environmental impact associated with pesticide use changes
with GM crops (and with the adoption of other production systems) has typically been presented
in the literature has been in terms of the volume (quantity) of pesticide applied. However, whilst
the amount of pesticide applied to a crop is one way of trying to measure the environmental
impact of pesticide use, this is not a good measure of environmental impact because the toxicity
and risk of each pesticide is not directly related to the amount (weight) applied. For example, the
environmental impact of applying one kg of dioxin to a crop or land is far more toxic than
applying 1 kg of salt. There exist alternative (and better) measures that have been used by a
number of authors of peer reviewed papers to assess the environmental impact of pesticide use
change with GM crops rather than simply looking at changes in the volume of active ingredient
applied to crops. In particular, there are a number of peer reviewed papers that utilise the
Environmental Impact Quotient (EIQ) developed at Cornell University by Kovach et al (1992) and
updated annually. This integrates the various environmental impacts of individual pesticides
(eg, on farm workers, consumers, ecology: see Appendix 4 for additional information) into a
single ‘field value per hectare’. The EIQ value is multiplied by the amount of pesticide active
ingredient (ai) used per hectare to produce a field EIQ value. For example, the EIQ rating for
glyphosate is 15.33. By using this rating multiplied by the amount of glyphosate used per hectare
(eg, a hypothetical example of 1.1 kg applied per ha), the field EIQ value for glyphosate would be
equivalent to 16.86/ha. The EIQ indicator used is therefore a comparison of the field EIQ/ha for
conventional versus GM crop production systems, with the total environmental impact or load of
each system, a direct function of respective field EIQ/ha values and the area planted to each type
of production (GM versus conventional). The use of environmental indicators is commonly used
by researchers and the EIQ indicator has been, for example, cited by Brimner et al (2004), in a
study comparing the environmental impacts of GM and conventional canola, and by Kleiter et al
(2005). The authors of this analysis have also used the EIQ indicator now for several years
because it:
•

•

Summarises significant amounts of information on pesticide impact into a single value
that, with data on usage rates (amount of active used per hectare) can be readily used to
make comparisons between different production systems across many regions and
countries;
Provides an improved assessment of the impact of GM crops on the environment when
compared to only examining changes in volume of active ingredient applied, because it
draws on some of the key toxicity and environmental exposure data related to individual
products, as applicable to impacts on farm workers, consumers and ecology.

The authors, do, however acknowledge that the EIQ is only a hazard indicator and has important
weaknesses (see for example, Peterson R and Schleier J (2014)). It is a hazard rating indicator that
does not assess risk or probability of exposure to pesticides. It also relies on qualitative
assumptions for the scaling and weighting of (quantitative) risk information that can result, for
example, in a low risk rating for one factor (eg, impact on farm workers) may cancel out a high
risk rating factor for another factor (eg, impact on ecology). Fundamentally, assessing the full
environmental impact of pesticide use changes with different production systems is complex and
requires an evaluation of risk exposure to pesticides at a site specific level. This requires
substantial collection of (site-specific) data (eg, on ground water levels, soil structure) and/or the
application of standard scenario models for exposure in a number of locations. Undertaking such
an exercise at a global level would require a substantial and ongoing input of labour and time, if

comprehensive environmental impact of pesticide change analysis is to be completed. It is not
surprising that no such exercise has, to date been undertaken, or likely to be in the near future.
Despite the acknowledged weaknesses of the EIQ as an indictor of pesticide environmental
impact, the authors of this paper continue to use the EIQ as an indicator of the environmental
impact of pesticide use change with GM crops because it is, in our view, a superior indicator to
only using amount of pesticide active ingredient applied and can be relatively easily replicated
across countries to facilitate comparisons. In this paper, the EIQ indicator is used in conjunction
with examining changes in the volume of pesticide active ingredient applied.
Detailed examples of the relevant amounts of active ingredient used and their associated field
EIQ values for GM versus conventional crops for the year 2014 are presented in Appendix 3.

4.1.1 GM herbicide tolerant (to glyphosate) soybeans (GM HT)
a) The USA
In examining the impact on herbicide usage in the US, two main sources of information have
been drawn on: USDA (NASS) national pesticide usage data and GfK Kynetec (GfK: private
market research sector) national farm survey-based pesticide usage data. Based on these sources
of information, the main features relating to herbicide usage on US soybeans over the last
nineteen years have been (Table 38 and Table 39):
•
•

•

The average amount of herbicide active ingredient (ai) used per hectare on the US
soybean crop has been fairly stable for the period to 2006, but has increased since then;
The average field EIQ/ha load has followed a broadly similar pattern of change as the
amount of active ingredient used, although the rate of increase in recent years has been
less significant than the rate of increase in active ingredient use;
A comparison of conventionally grown soybeans (per ha) with GM HT soybeans (Table
39) shows that herbicide ai use on conventional soybeans has also followed a similar
pattern of change to GM HT soybeans. Initially usage was fairly stable (at around 1.1 to
1.3kg/ha compared to 1.3 to 1.4kg/ha for GM HT soybeans). Since 2006, the average
amount of herbicide active ingredient applied to conventional soybeans has followed the
same upward path as usage on GM HT soybeans. The increased usage of herbicides on
GM HT soybeans partly reflects the increasing incidence of weed resistance to glyphosate
that has occurred in recent years (see section 4.1.9 for additional discussion). This has
been attributed to how glyphosate was used; because of its broad-spectrum postemergence activity, it was often used as the sole method of weed control. This approach
to weed control put tremendous selection pressure on weeds and as a result contributed
to the evolution of weed populations predominated by resistant individual weeds. In
addition, the facilitating role of the technology in the adoption of no and reduced tillage
production techniques has also probably contributed to the emergence of weeds resistant
to herbicides like glyphosate and to weed shifts towards those weed species that are
inherently not well controlled by glyphosate. Some of the glyphosate resistant species,
such as marestail (Conyza canadensis), waterhemp (Amaranthus tuberculatus) and palmer
pigweed (Amaranthus palmeri) are now widespread in the US.

GM crop impact: 1996-2014

Growers of GM HT crops in the US are increasingly being advised to be more proactive
and include other herbicides (with different and complementary modes of action) in
combination with glyphosate (and in some cases reverting back to ploughing) in their
integrated weed management systems, even where instances of weed resistance to
glyphosate have not been found.
This proactive, diversified approach to weed management is therefore the principal
strategy for avoiding the emergence of herbicide resistant weeds in GM HT crops. A
proactive weed management programme generally requires less herbicide, has a better
environmental profile and is more economical than a reactive weed management
programme.
At the macro level, the adoption of both reactive and proactive weed management
programmes in GM HT crops has influenced the mix, total amount and overall
environmental profile of herbicides applied to GM HT soybeans (and to cotton, corn and
canola) in the last 7-10 years. This is shown in the evidence relating to changes in
herbicide use, as illustrated in Table 38 and Table 39. Thus, in 2014, 74% of the GM HT
soybean crop received an additional herbicide treatment of one of the following (four
most used, after glyphosate) active ingredients 67 2,4-D, chlorimuron, flumioxazin and
sulfentrazone. This compares with 14% of the GM HT soybean crop receiving a
treatment of one of these four herbicide active ingredients in 2006. As a result, the
average amount of herbicide active ingredient applied to the GM HT soybean crop in the
US (per hectare) increased by about 64% over this period. This compared with the
average amount of herbicide active ingredient applied to the small conventional (non
GM) soybean alternative which also increased by 84% over the same period. The
increase in the use of herbicides on conventional soybeans reflects a shift in herbicide use
(more herbicides) rather than an increase in dose rates and can therefore be partly
attributed to the on-going development of weed resistance to non-glyphosate herbicides
commonly used. This highlights that the development of weed resistance to herbicides is
a problem faced by all farmers, regardless of production method (also see section 4.1.9 for
more detailed discussion of weed resistance issues);
A comparison of average field EIQs/ha also shows fairly stable values for both
conventional and GM HT soybean crops for most of the period to the mid 2000s,
followed by increases in recent years. The average load rating for GM HT soybean crops
has been lower than the average load rating for conventional soybeans for most of the
period, 2008-2014 excepted, despite the continued shift to no/low tillage production
systems that rely much more on herbicide-based weed control than conventional tillage
systems and the adoption of reactive and proactive weed resistance management
programmes. Since 2006, the average field EIQ/ha ratings on GM HT soybean and
conventional soybean crops have increased significantly on both production systems.

The comparison data between the GM HT crop and the conventional alternative presented above
is, however, of limited value because of bias in respect of the conventional crop usage data. The
very small area of conventional crop from which herbicide usage data is obtained means that the
data poorly represents what might reasonably be considered as the ‘conventional alternative’ if
GM HT technology was not available.
The reasons why the conventional cropping data set is likely to be biased and unrepresentative of
the levels of herbicide use that might reasonably be expected in the absence of biotechnology
include:
•

•

•

Whilst the degree of weed problems/damage vary by year, region and within region,
farmers who continue to farm conventionally may be those with relatively low levels of
weed problems, and hence see little, if any, economic benefit from using the GM HT
traits targeted at minimal weed problems. Their herbicide usage levels therefore tend to
be below the levels that would reasonably be expected on an average farm with more
typical weed infestations;
Some of the farms continuing to use conventional seed generally use extensive, low
intensity production methods (including organic) which feature limited (below average)
use of herbicides. The usage patterns of this sub-set of growers is therefore likely to
understate usage for the majority of farmers if they all returned to farming without the
use of GM HT technology;
Some of the farmers using GM HT traits have experienced improvements in weed control
from using this technology relative to the conventional control methods previously used.
If these farmers were to now revert to using conventional techniques, it is likely that most
would wish to maintain the levels of weed control delivered with use of the GM HT traits
and therefore some would use higher levels of herbicide than they did in the pre GM HT
crop days.

In addition, the use of no/low tillage production systems also tends to be less prominent amongst
conventional soybean growers compared to GM HT growers. As such, the average herbicide
ai/ha and EIQ/ha values recorded for all remaining conventional soybean growers tends to fall
and be lower than the average would have been had all growers still been using conventional
technology.
This problem of bias has been addressed, firstly by using the average recorded values for
herbicide usage on conventional crops for years only when the conventional crop accounted for
more than 50% of the total crop and, secondly, in other years (eg, from 1999 for soybeans, from
2001 for cotton and from 2007 for corn in the US) applying estimates of the likely usage if the
whole US crop was no longer using crop biotechnology, based on opinion from extension and

industry advisors across the US 68. In addition, the usage levels identified from this methodology
were cross checked (and subject to adjustment) against historic average usage levels of key
herbicide active ingredients from the GfK dataset, so as to minimise the scope for understating or
overstating likely usage levels on the conventional alternative.
67F

Based on this approach, the respective values for conventional soybeans in the last nine years are
shown in Table 40. These usage levels were then compared to typical and recommended weed
control regimes for GM HT soybeans and recorded usage levels on the GM HT crop (which
accounted for over 90% of the total crop since 2007), using the dataset from GfK. The key features
of this comparison are that the average amount of active ingredient used on conventional
soybeans, if this type of production were to replace the current area planted to GM HT soybeans,
is roughly similar to current GM HT herbicide usage levels, but a switch to conventional
soybeans would result in a higher average field EIQ/ha value (in other words the conventional
soybean system would be worse for the environment in terms of toxicity than the GM HT
system).

Using this methodology for comparing conventional versus GM HT soybean herbicide usage, the
estimated national level changes in herbicide use and the environmental impact associated with
the adoption of GM HT soybeans 69 (Table 41) shows:
68F

•

•

In 2014, there was a small net decrease in herbicide ai use of 0.4% (0.3 million kg). The
EIQ load was lower by a more significant 13% compared with the conventional (no/low
tillage) alternative (ie, if all of the US soybean crop had been planted to conventional
soybeans);
Cumulatively since 1996, there have been savings in both active ingredient use and the
associated environmental impact (as measured by the EIQ indicator) of -3.5% (32.6
million kg) in active ingredient usage and -24.1% for the field EIQ load.

advisors in over 50 US states. Subsequent years have been updated by the author

The analysis of impact in Canada is based on comparisons of typical herbicide regimes used for

Overall, this identifies:

Up to 2006, an average ai/ha and field EIQ value/ha for GM HT soybeans of 0.9 kg/ha and
13.8/ha respectively, compared to conventional soybeans with 1.43 kg/ha of ai and a field
EIQ/ha of 34.2;
Post 2006, the same values for conventional with 1.32 kg/ai and a field EIQ/ha of 20.88 for
GM HT soybeans.

Based on these values, at the national level 71, in 2014, there was a net decrease in the volume of
active ingredient used of 4.6% (-147,000 kg) and a 23.4% decrease in associated environmental
impact (as measured by the EIQ indicator: Table 42). Cumulatively since 1997, there has been a

c) Brazil
Drawing on herbicide usage data from AMIS Global and Kleffmann, plus information from
industry and extension advisers, the annual average use of herbicide active ingredient per ha in
the early years of GM HT adoption was estimated to be a difference of 0.22kg/ha (ie, GM HT
soybeans used 0.22 kg/ha less of herbicide active ingredient) and resulted in a net saving of 15.62
field EIQ/ha units. More recent data on herbicide usage, however, suggests a change in herbicide
regimes used in both systems, partly due to changes in herbicide availability, prices, increasing
adoption of reduced/no tillage production practices (in both conventional and GM HT soybeans)
and weed resistance issues. As a result, estimated values for the respective systems in 2014 (see
Appendix 3) were:
•
•

An average active ingredient use of 2.59 kg/ha for GM HT soybeans compared to 2.53
kg/ha for conventional soybeans;
The average field EIQ/ha value for the two production systems were 40.63/ha for GM HT
soybeans compared to 47.4/ha for conventional soybeans 72.
71 F

Based on the above herbicide usage data, (Table 43):
•

In 2014, the total herbicide active ingredient use was 2.3% lower on GM HT crops than it
would likely have been if the crop had been conventional. The EIQ/ha environmental
load was 13.3% lower than if the crop had been conventional;

Cumulatively since 1997, there has been a 3.2% increase in herbicide active ingredient use
(31.8 million kg). However, there has been a 5.7% reduction in the environmental impact
(871 million field EIQ/ha units).

d) Argentina
In assessing the changes in herbicide use associated with the adoption of GM HT soybeans in
Argentina, it is important to take into consideration the following contextual factors:
•

•

Prior to the first adoption of GM HT soybeans in 1996, 5.9 million ha of soybeans were
grown, mostly using conventional tillage systems. The average use of herbicides was
limited (1.1 kg ai/ha with an average field EIQ/ha value of 21);
In 2014, the area planted to soybeans was 19.7 million ha. Almost all of this (99%) was
planted to varieties containing the GM HT trait, and 90% plus of this area used
no/reduced tillage systems that rely more on herbicide-based weed control programmes
than conventional tillage systems.

Since 1996, the use of herbicides in Argentine soybean production has increased, both in terms of
the volume of herbicide ai used and the average field EIQ/ha loading. In 2014, the estimated
average herbicide ai use was 3.11kg/ha and the average field EIQ was 48.24/ha 73. Given 99% of
the total crop is GM HT; these values effectively represent the typical values of use and impact
for GM HT soybeans in Argentina.

GM crop impact: 1996-2014

These changes should, however, be assessed within the context of the fundamental changes in
tillage systems that have occurred over the 1996-2014 period (some of which may possibly have
taken place in the absence of the GM HT technology 74). Also, the expansion in soybean plantings
has included some areas that had previously been considered too weedy for profitable soybean
cultivation. This means that comparing current herbicide use patterns with those of 19 years ago
is not a reasonably representative comparison of the levels of herbicide use under a GM HT
reduced/no tillage production system and a conventional reduced/no tillage soybean production
system.
73F

To make a representative comparison of usage of the GM HT crop, with what might reasonably
be expected if all of the GM HT crop reverted to conventional soybean production, requires
identification of typical herbicide treatment regimes for conventional soybeans that would
deliver similar levels of weed control (in a no tillage production system) as achieved in the GM
HT system. To do this, we identified a number of alternative conventional treatments in the mid
2000s and again more recently in 2013/14 (see Appendix 3). Based on these, the current GM HT
largely no tillage production system, has a slightly higher volume of herbicide ai use (3.11 kg/ha
compared to 2.82 kg/ha) than its conventional no tillage alternative. However, in terms of
associated environmental impact, as measured by the EIQ methodology, the GM HT system
delivers a small 1% improvement (GM HT field EIQ of 48.24/ha compared to 48.75/ha for
conventional no/low tillage soybeans).
At the national level these reductions in herbicide use 75 are equivalent to:
74F

•

•

In 2014, a 10.3% increase in the volume of herbicide ai used (5.8 million kg) but a net 1%
reduction in the associated environmental impact, as measured by the EIQ indicator (9.9
million EIQ/ha units);
Cumulatively since 1996, there has been a net increase in herbicide ai use of +0.5% (+4.3
million kg) but a lower (net environmental gain) field EIQ load of 9.1% lower (1,33
million field EIQ/ha units) than the level that might reasonably be expected if the total
Argentine soybean area had been planted to conventional cultivars using a no/low
tillage production system.

e) Paraguay
The analysis presented below for Paraguay is based on AMIS Global usage data for the soybean
crop and estimates of conventional alternative equivalents. Based on this, the respective
differences for herbicide ai use and field EIQ values for GM HT and conventional soybeans in
2014 were:
•
•

Conventional soybeans: average volume of herbicide used 3.03 kg/ha and a field EIQ/ha
value of 51.84/ha;
GM HT soybeans: average volume of herbicide used 3.18 kg/ha and a field EIQ/ha value
of 50.6/ha.

74
It is likely that the trend to increased use of reduced and no till systems would have continued in the absence of GM HT technology.
However, the availability of this technology has probably played a major role in facilitating and maintaining reduced and no till
systems at levels that would otherwise have not arisen
75

GM crop impact: 1996-2014

Using these values, the level of herbicide ai use and the total EIQ load in 2014 were respectively
4.7% higher in terms of active ingredient use (+0.48 million kg), and lower by 2.3% in terms of
associated environmental impact as measured by the EIQ indicator (4 million EIQ/ha units).
Cumulatively, since 1999, herbicide ai use has been 5.5% higher (3.3 million kg 76) whilst the
associated environmental impact, as measured by the EIQ indicator, was 4.9% lower (ie, despite
an increase in active ingredient use, there was a net improvement in environmental impact
associated with herbicide use).
75F

f) Uruguay
Analysis for Uruguay also draws on AMIS Global data and estimates of the herbicide regime on
conventional alternatives that would deliver a level of weed control with equal efficacy to GM
HT soybeans. Based on this, the respective values for 2014 were:
•
•

Conventional soybeans: average volume of herbicide used 2.82 kg/ha and a field EIQ/ha
value of 48.75/ha;
GM HT soybeans: average volume of herbicide used 2.98 kg/ha and a field EIQ/ha value
of 47.48/ha.

Using these values, the level of herbicide ai use and the total EIQ load in 2014 were respectively
5.7% higher in terms of active ingredient use (+216,000 kg), but lower by 2.6% in terms of
associated environmental impact as measured by the EIQ indicator (-1.7 million EIQ/ha units).
Cumulatively, since 1999, herbicide ai use has been 2.9% higher (662,000 kg) whilst the associated
environmental impact, as measured by the EIQ indicator, was 7.3% lower.
g) Bolivia
As no data on herbicide use in Bolivia has been identified, usage values and assumptions for
differences in the adjacent country of Paraguay have been used. On this basis, the impact values
are as follows:
•
•

In 2014, a 4.1% increase in the volume of herbicide ai used (159,000 kg) but a net 2%
reduction in the associated environmental impact, as measured by the EIQ indicator;
Cumulatively since 2005, there has been a net increase in herbicide ai use of 5.5% (+1
million kg) but a net reduction in the field EIQ load of 2.9%.

h) Romania
Romania joined the EU at the beginning of 2007 and therefore was no longer officially permitted
to grow GM HT soybeans. The analysis below therefore refers to the period 1999-2006. Based on
herbicide usage data for the years 2000-2003 from Brookes (2005), the adoption of GM HT
soybeans in Romania has resulted in a small net increase in the volume of herbicide active
ingredient applied, but a net reduction in the EIQ load. More specifically:
•
•

76

The average volume of herbicide ai applied has increased by 0.09 kg/ha to 1.35 kg/ha;
The average field EIQ/ha has decreased from 23/ha for conventional soybeans to 21/ha
for GM HT soybeans.

Up to 2006, estimated ai use was slightly higher for conventional relative to GM HT soybeans by 0.03 kg/ha

©PG Economics Ltd 2016

90

GM crop impact: 1996-2014

This data has been used as the base for analysis of the environmental impact associated with
herbicide use up to 2003. For the period 2003 to 2006, this has been updated by herbicide usage
data from AMIS Global. Accordingly, in 2006, the average amount of herbicide active ingredient
applied to the GM HT soybean crop was 0.87 kg/ha (field EIQ/ha of 13.03) compared to 0.99 kg/ha
for conventional soybeans (field EIQ/ha of 19.09). Overall, during the 1999-2006 period, the total
volume of herbicide ai use was 2% higher (equal to about 15,600 kg) than the level of use if the
crop had been all non GM since 1999 but the field EIQ load had fallen by 11%.
With the banning of planting of GM HT soybeans in 2007, there has been a net negative
environmental impact associated with herbicide use on the subsequent Romanian soybean crop,
as farmers will have had to resort to conventional chemistry to control weeds. For example,
based on AMIS Global herbicide usage data for 2011, when the entire crop was conventional, the
average amount of herbicide active ingredient applied per ha had increased by 80% and the
average field EIQ/ha rating by 95% relative to 2006 usage levels on GM HT soybeans. This
suggests a significant deterioration in the environmental impact associated with herbicide usage
on soybeans since the GM HT technology was banned from usage.
i) South Africa
GM HT soybeans have been grown in South Africa since 2000. Analysis of impact on herbicide
use and the associated environmental impact of these crops (based on AMIS Global data and
typical herbicide treatment regimes for GM HT soybeans and conventional soybeans: see
Appendix 3) shows the following:
•
•

Since 1999, the total volume of herbicide ai use has been 4.7% lower (equal to 301,000 kg
of ai) than the level of use if the crop had been conventional;
The field EIQ load has fallen by 19.8% (equal to 25 million field EIQ/ha units) since 1999
(in 2014 the EIQ load was 35% lower).

j) Mexico
Analysis of the impact on herbicide use and the associated environmental impact of the planting
of GM HT soybeans in Mexico (planted on a farm level trial basis since 2004 on an annual area of
between 10,000 ha and 20,000 ha) shows the following:
•
•

Conventional soybeans: in 2014, the average volume of herbicide used was 1.76 kg/ha
and the associated field EIQ/ha value was 41.02/ha;
GM HT soybeans: the average volume of herbicide used was 1.62 kg/ha and the
associated field EIQ/ha value was 24.83/ha in 2014.

Since 2004, the total volume of herbicide ai use has been 1% lower (equal to about 19,750 kg of ai)
than the level of use if the crop had been conventional. The field EIQ load was also lower by
4.7%.
k) Summary of impact
Across all of the countries that have adopted GM HT soybeans since 1996, the net impact on
herbicide use and the associated environmental impact 77 has been (Figure 15):
76F

GM crop impact: 1996-2014

•

•

In 2014, a 3.3% increase in the total volume of herbicide ai applied (7.8 million kg) but a
10% reduction in the environmental impact (measured in terms of the field EIQ/ha
load);
Since 1996, 0.2% more herbicide ai has been used (7.8 million kg) but the environmental
impact applied to the soybean crop has fallen (an environmental improvement) by
14.1%.

This analysis takes into consideration changes in herbicide use, in recent years, on GM HT
soybeans, that have occurred to specifically address the issue of weed resistance to glyphosate in
some regions. Compared to several years ago, the amount of herbicide active ingredient applied
and number of herbicides used with GM HT soybeans in many regions has increased, and the
associated environmental profile, as measured by the EIQ indicator, deteriorated. However,
relative to the conventional alternative, the environmental profile of GM HT soybean crop use
has continued to offer important advantages 78 and in most cases, provides an improved
environmental profile compared to the conventional alternative (as measured by the EIQ
indicator).
77 F

soybeans in all adopting countries 1996-2014

78

Also, many of the herbicides used in conventional production systems had significant resistance issues themselves in the mid 1990s.
This was, for example, one of the reasons why glyphosate tolerant soybeans were rapidly adopted, as glyphosate provided good
control of these weeds

4.1.2 GM herbicide tolerant (to glyphosate) and insect resistant soybeans
(Intacta)
GM IR soybeans (stacked with second generation a GM HT trait) were planted commercially in
South America for the first time in 2013-14 (Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay). Drawing
on pre-adoption insecticide usage data (source: AMIS Global) and post adoption site monitoring
of conventional versus Intacta soybean plots (source: Monsanto), the following key points
relating to insecticide use change have been identified:
•

•

Intacta soybeans have enabled soybean growers to reduce the average number of
insecticide treatments by about 4 (from an average of 8-10 sprays on conventional or GM
HT only crops) in Brazil. In the other three adopting countries, average insecticide
treatments have fallen by an average of 1.5;
The average insecticide use saving from using Intacta soybeans has been about 0.17 kg of
active ingredient and an associated field EIQ/ha saving of 17.25/ha in Brazil. In the other
countries, the average insecticide use saving has been about 0.08 kg of active ingredient
and an associated field EIQ/ha saving of 1.26/ha;

Based on these savings, in 2014, the use of this technology resulted in a reduction of 1.1 million
kg of insecticide active ingredient use, equal to 1.2% of total insecticide used on the soybean crops
in the four countries. The EIQ saving in 2014 was equal to 3.8%. Over the two years, the total
insecticide active ingredient usage saving has been 1.52 million kg (-0.9%) and the associated
environmental impact, as measured by the EIQ indicator fell by 2.7%.

4.1.3 GM Herbicide tolerant (GM HT) maize
a) The US
Drawing on the two main statistical sources of pesticide usage data (USDA and GfK), Table 44
and Table 45 summarise the key features:
•

•

•

The average herbicide ai/ha used on a GM HT maize crop has been about 0.6 to 0.7 kg/ha
lower than the average usage on the residual conventional crop in the period to about
2007. Since then, the differential between the increasingly GM HT crop and small
conventional crop has narrowed, so that by 2010, average levels of active ingredient use
were broadly similar and since 2011, the average amount of herbicide active applied to
the GM HT crop has been higher than the usage on the small conventional crop;
The average field EIQ/ha used on a GM HT crop has been about 20/ha units lower than
the conventional crop, although in the last five years the difference has narrowed and are
now similar;
The recent increase in ai use and the associated field EIQ/ha for GM HT maize mainly
reflects the increasing concern about herbicide resistance and the adoption of integrated
(reactive and proactive) weed management practices designed to address the issue of
weed resistance to glyphosate (see section 4.1.9 for more detailed discussion). There has
been an increasing proportion of the GM HT crop receiving additional treatments with
herbicides such as acetochlor, atrazine, 2 4,D, mesotrione and S metolachlor as well as use
of new chemistry such as tembutrione as recommended by public and private sector
weed scientists.

As the herbicide usage data for the relatively small conventional crop presented in Table 45 is
likely to be biased and unrepresentative (see section 4.1.1), the alternative that would deliver a
similar level of weed control to the level delivered in the GM HT system, based on recommended
practices from extension advisors and industry analysts 79 since 2007 80 (see appendix 1 for details)
is summarised in Table 46. These conventional crop herbicide usage levels were then compared
to recorded usage levels on the GM HT crop (which accounted for a majority of the total crop
since 2007), using the dataset from GfK.

Through this more representative usage data for conventional corn and comparison with GM HT
corn, it is evident that the average herbicide active ingredient use for conventional corn is higher
than GM HT corn. The associated environmental load, as measured by the EIQ indicator, for
conventional corn is also significantly worse for conventional corn when compared to GM HT
corn.
At the national level (Table 47), in 2014, there has been an annual saving in the volume of
herbicide active ingredient use of 11.1% (12.6 million kg). The annual field EIQ load on the US
maize crop has also fallen by 14.5% in 2014 (equal to 327 million field EIQ/ha units). The
cumulative decrease in active ingredient use since 1997 has been 9.9% (193 million kg), and the
cumulative reduction in the field EIQ load has been 13.7%.

b) Canada
The impact on herbicide use in the Canadian maize crop has been similar to the impact reported
above in the US. Using industry sourced information 81 about typical herbicide regimes for
conventional and GM HT maize (see Appendix 3), the key impact findings are:
80F

•

•
•

•

The herbicide ai/ha load on a GM HT crop has been between 0.88 kg/ha (GM glyphosate
tolerant) and 1.069 kg/ha (GM glufosinate tolerant) lower than the conventional maize
equivalent crop (average herbicide ai use at 2.71 kg/ha);
The field EIQ/ha values for GM glyphosate and GM glufosinate tolerant maize are
respectively 36/ha and 39/ha compared to 61/ha for conventional maize;
At the national level in 2014 (based on the plantings of the different production systems),
the reductions in herbicide ai use and the total field EIQ load were respectively 31% (1
million kg) and 38% (28.7 million: Table 48);
Cumulatively since 1997, total national herbicide ai use has fallen by 16.4% (9.1 million
kg) and the total EIQ load has fallen by 19.4% (244 million field EIQ units).

c) South Africa
Drawing on herbicide usage data from AMIS Global and industry level sources that compare
typical herbicide treatment regimes for conventional and GM HT maize in South Africa (see
appendix 3), the impact of using GM HT technology in the South African maize crop (1.99 million
ha in 2014) has been:
•
•

•

On a per hectare basis in 2014 there has been a 0.3kg decrease in the amount of herbicide
active ingredient used and an improvement in the average field EIQ of 12.46/ha;
In 2014, at the national level, the amount of herbicide used was 597,000 kgs (-6.2%) lower
than the amount that would probably have been used if the crop had all been planted to
conventional seed. The total field EIQ load was 12.3% lower;
Cumulatively since 2003, total national herbicide ai use has fallen by 2.2% (2.16 million
kg) and the total EIQ load has fallen by 6.4%.

d) Argentina
Using a combination of AMIS Global herbicide usage data and industry estimates of typical
herbicide regimes for the two different systems (see Appendix 3), the impact of GM HT maize use
in Argentina has been as follows (first used commercially in 2004):
•

•

•
•

The average volume of herbicide ai applied to GM HT maize was typically lower than
the amount used on the conventional crop, although more recently the amount used on
the GM HT crop has increased – in 2014 the average amount used on the GM HT crop
was higher, at about 3.99 kg ai/ha compared to about 3.53 kg ai/ha for conventional
maize;
The average field EIQ/ha load for GM HT maize has been significantly lower than the
conventional counterpart, although with the increase in ai use on the GM HT crop in
recent years the difference between the two systems has narrowed. In 2014, the
respective average EIQ/ha values were 71.8/ha for GM HT maize and 73.61/ha for
conventional maize;
The increase in the volume of herbicide used in 2014 was 1.76 million kg (+8.3%). Since
2004, there has, however been a net reduction in usage of 1.5% (-1.9 million kg);
In terms of the field EIQ load, the reduction in 2014 was 2% (-6.9 million field/ha units)
and over the period 2004-2014, the EIQ load factor fell by 7.2%.

GM crop impact: 1996-2014

e) Brazil
Brazil first used GM HT maize commercially in 2010, and in 2014, the area planted to seed
containing this trait was 7.98 million ha. Drawing on a combination of sources (AMIS Global,
industry and Galvao (2012-2014)); the estimated environmental impact associated with changes
in herbicide use on this crop is as follows:
•

•
•

The average amount of herbicide active use and associated field EIQ/ha rating for GM
HT maize in 2014 was 3.91kg/ha and 70.29/ha respectively. This compared with
conventional maize with herbicide active ingredient use of 3.99 kg/ha and a field EIQ
rating of 86.15/ha;
In 2014, the use of GM HT technology resulted in a saving in the use of 0.65 million kg of
herbicide active ingredient (-1%) and a reduction in the EIQ rating of 9.3%;
Cumulatively (2010-2014), the herbicide active ingredient usage saving has been 2.5% (7.3 million kg), with an EIQ load reduction of 7.2%.

f) Uruguay
GM HT maize was first used in Uruguay in 2011, and in 2014 was planted on 92% of the total
maize crop (76,330 ha of GM HT maize – all as stacked seed with both GM HT and GM IR traits).
Industry contacts point to weed control practices and herbicides used in Uruguay to be very
similar to those used in Argentina. We have therefore applied the Argentine herbicide usage
assumptions for both conventional and GM HT maize crops in Uruguay. Based on these
assumptions, since 2011, the adoption of GM HT maize has resulted in a net reduction in
herbicide ai use on the maize crop of 52,900 kg of active ingredient (-0.7%) and a 10.4%
improvement in the aggregate field EIQ/ha load.
g) Other countries
GM HT maize was also grown commercially in the Philippines, for the first time in 2006 and
688,000 ha used this technology in 2014. Weed control practices in maize in the Philippines are
based on a combination of use of herbicides and hand weeding, with only about a third of the
crop annually receiving herbicide treatments (ie, the majority of the crop, much of which is a
subsistence crop, uses hand weeding as the primary form of weed control). The authors are not
aware of any analysis which has examined the impact on herbicide use and the associated
environmental ‘footprint’ of using GM HT maize in the Philippines.
GM HT maize was also grown in Colombia on 54,850 ha in 2014 and in Paraguay (2014, 500,000
ha). Analysis of the environmental impact associated with changes in herbicide use on these
crops has not been possible due to a lack of data.
h) Summary of impact
In the countries where GM HT maize has been most widely adopted, there has been a net
decrease in both the volume of herbicides applied to maize and a net reduction in the
environmental impact applied to the crop (Figure 16). More specifically:
•

In 2014, total herbicide ai use was 6% lower (13.2 million kg) than the level of use if the
total crop had been planted to conventional varieties. The EIQ load was also lower by
12.1%;

©PG Economics Ltd 2016

98

GM crop impact: 1996-2014

•

Cumulatively since 1997, the volume of herbicide ai applied is 8.4% lower than its
conventional equivalent (a saving of 214 million kg). The EIQ load has been reduced by
12.6%.

As with the GM HT soybean analysis, this analysis takes into consideration changes in herbicide
use, in recent years, on GM HT maize that have specifically addressed the issue of weed
resistance to glyphosate in some regions. The trend in herbicide use is broadly similar to
soybeans, though less significant; the average amount of herbicide active ingredient use initially
fell with the adoption of GM HT maize, but has, in the last few years, increased. At the same
time, usage levels on conventional maize crops have also tended to increase, partly due to weed
resistance (to herbicides other than glyphosate). Overall, however, the net environmental impact
associated with the herbicides used on GM HT crops continues to represent an improvement
relative to environmental impact associated with herbicide use on conventional forms of
production.

Drawing on the herbicide usage data from the USDA and GfK, both the volume of ai used and
the average field EIQ/ha on the US cotton crop remained fairly stable to the mid 2000s, although
since then there has been a rise in usage (Table 49).

A comparison of average active ingredient usage for GM HT and conventional cotton (Table 50),
shows that the average level of herbicide ai use (per ha) on GM HT cotton has been consistently
higher than the average level of usage on the relatively small conventional cotton crop. In terms
of the average field EIQ/ha, there has been a marginally lower average field EIQ rating for GM
HT cotton in the first few years of adoption, but since then, the average field EIQ/ha rating has
been lower for conventional cotton.

As the herbicide usage data for the conventional crop presented in Table 50 is likely to be biased
and unrepresentative 82, an alternative that would deliver a similar level of weed control to the
level delivered in the GM HT system, based on recommended practices from extension advisors
and industry analysts 83 since 2006 (see appendix 1 for details), is summarised in Table 51. These
conventional crop herbicide usage levels were then compared to recorded usage levels on the GM
HT crop since 2006, using the dataset from GfK.

weed resistance management practices

Using this more representative herbicide usage data for conventional cotton and comparing it to
recorded GM HT usage, the average herbicide active ingredient use and the associated
environmental load, as measured by the EIQ indicator, for conventional cotton is higher than GM
HT cotton. Since the mid 2000s, the average amount of herbicide active ingredient used on GM
HT cotton has increased through a combination of additional usage of glyphosate (about a 30%
increase in usage per hectare) in conjunction with increasing use of other herbicides. All of the
GM HT crop area planted to seed tolerant to glyphosate received treatments of glyphosate and at
least one of the next five most used herbicides (trifluralin, acetochlor, S metolachlor, fomesafen
82
This is particularly relevant to cotton because much of the conventional cotton crop still being grown is concentrated in regions
which traditionally use extensive production systems (eg, Texas)
83
The original analyses by Sankala and Blumenthal (2006) and Johnson and Strom (2008) were based on consultations with extension
advisors in over 50 US states. Subsequent years have been updated by the author

and pendimethalin). This compares with 2006, when only three-quarters of the glyphosate
tolerant crop received at least one treatment from the next five most used herbicides (2 4-D,
trifluralin, pyrithiobic, pendimethalin and diuron). In other words, a quarter of the glyphosate
tolerant crop used only glyphosate for weed control in 2006 compared to none of the crop relying
solely on glyphosate in 2014. This suggests that US cotton farmers are increasingly adopting
current recommended practices for managing weed resistant to glyphosate (and other
herbicides).
Using this basis for comparing herbicide regimes for conventional and GM HT cotton at the
national level (Table 52), shows that the impact of using the GM HT technology in 2014 resulted
in a 6.6% decrease in the amount of herbicide use (1.15 million kg) and a 13.3% decrease in the
associated environmental impact, as measured by the EIQ indicator. Cumulatively since 1997,
there have been savings in herbicide use of 5.8% for ai use (16 million kg) and an 8.1% reduction
in the associated environmental impact, as measured by the EIQ indicator.

GM crop impact: 1996-2014

•

The herbicide ai/ha load on the original first generation GM HT crop was about 0.11
kg/ha higher (at 2.87 kg/ha) than the conventional cotton equivalent crop (2.77 kg/ha).
With the introduction of the Roundup Ready Flex cotton in 2006, the average amount of
herbicide active ingredient applied to the GM HT crop has, however fallen to an average
level lower than the conventional equivalent. In 2014, the average herbicide ai use/ha on
the GM HT crop was about 3.1 kg/ha compared to 4.76 kg/ha on the conventional
equivalent crop 85;
The average field EIQ/ha value for the original GM HT cotton has been 65/ha, compared
to 69/ha for conventional cotton. Under the Roundup Ready Flex versus conventional
equivalent, the environmental load difference in favour of the GM HT cotton increased.
Thus in 2014, the average field EIQ/ha for GM HT cotton was just under 52/ha compared
to 87.5/ha for the conventional cotton equivalent;
Based on the above data, at the national level (Table 53), in 2013, herbicide ai use has
been 34.6% lower than the level expected if the whole crop had been planted to
conventional cotton cultivars. The total field EIQ load was 40% lower;
Cumulatively since 2000, total national herbicide ai use fell by 10.3% (2.3 million kg) and
the total EIQ load decreased by 13.7%.

GM crop impact: 1996-2014

•

•

•

In 2014, there has been an average 0.1 kg decrease in the amount of herbicide active
ingredient used and a 13% decrease in the environmental impact, as measured by the
EIQ indicator (-4.3 field EIQ/ha units);
At the national level, the amount of herbicide used in 2014 was 154 kg (0.5%) lower than
the amount that would probably have been used if the crop had all been planted to
conventional seed. The total field EIQ load was, however, a more significant 13.4%
lower;
Cumulatively since 2001, total national herbicide ai use increased by 1% (5,200 kg), whilst
the total EIQ load fell by 7.6%. This shows that although the amount of herbicide used
on the cotton crop has increased since the availability and use of GM HT cotton, the
associated environmental impact of herbicide use on the cotton crop has fallen.

d) Argentina
GM HT cotton has been grown commercially in Argentina since 2002, and in 2014, all of the
412,000 ha cotton crop used seed containing this trait.
Based on industry level information relating to typical herbicide treatment regimes for GM HT
and conventional cotton (see appendix 3), the impact of using this technology on herbicide use
and the associated environmental impact has been:
•

•

In 2014, the national level reduction in the amount of herbicide applied to the cotton crop
was 0.27 million kg (-20%) lower than would otherwise have occurred if the whole crop
had been planted to conventional varieties. The associated EIQ load was 18% lower;
Cumulatively, since 2002, the amount of herbicide active ingredient applied had fallen
28% (-4.7 million kg). The field EIQ rating associated with herbicide use on the
Argentine cotton crop fell 32% over the same period.

e) Other countries
Cotton farmers in Mexico, Colombia, Brazil and Paraguay have also been using GM HT
technology since 2005, 2006, 2009 and 2013 respectively. No analysis is presented for the impact
of using this technology in these countries because of the limited availability of herbicide usage
data.
f) Summary of impact
In 2014, the overall effect of using GM HT cotton technology (Figure 17) in the adopting countries
has been a reduction in herbicide ai use 86 of 8.9% and a decrease in the total environmental
impact of 15%. Cumulatively since 1997, herbicide ai use fell by 7.3% (-23.1 million kg) and the
associated environmental impact fell by 9.9%.
85F

As with the analysis of herbicide use changes on GM HT soybeans and maize, this analysis takes
into consideration changes in herbicide use, in recent years, on GM HT cotton that have occurred
to specifically address the issue of weed resistance to glyphosate in some regions (notably the
US). Such actions have resulted in a significant number of (US) cotton farmers using additional
herbicides to glyphosate with GM HT cotton (that were not used in the early years of GM HT (to

active ingredient applied per ha. Nevertheless, the net environmental impact associated with the
herbicides used on GM HT crops in 2014 continues to represent an improvement relative to the
environmental profile of herbicides that would likely be used if the crop reverted to using
conventional (non GM) technology.

4.1.5 GM Herbicide tolerant (GM HT) canola
a) The US
Based on analysis of typical herbicide treatments for conventional, GM glyphosate tolerant and
GM glufosinate tolerant canola identified in Sankala and Blumenthal (2003 & 2006), Johnson and
Strom (2008), updates for 2014 undertaken as part of this research and data from the GfK dataset
(see Appendix 3), the changes in herbicide use and resulting environmental impact arising from
adoption of GM HT canola in the US since 1999 87 are summarised in Table 54. This shows
consistent savings in terms of both the amount of herbicide active ingredient applied and the EIQ
value for glyphosate and glufosinate tolerant canola relative to conventional canola.

The reduction in the volume of herbicides used was equal to 144,000 kg of active ingredient (20.4%) in 2014. In terms of the EIQ load, this had fallen by 5.6 million field EIQ units (-39%)
compared to the load that would otherwise have been applied if the entire crop had been planted
to conventional varieties. Cumulatively, since 1999, the amount of active ingredient use has
fallen by 34%, and the EIQ load reduced by 47%.
b) Canada
Reductions in herbicide use and the environmental ‘foot print’ associated with the adoption of
GM HT canola, have also been found in Canada:
•

The analysis applied to the early years of adoption is base on the average volume of
herbicide ai applied to GM HT canola being 0.65 kg/ha (GM glyphosate tolerant) and
0.39 kg/ha (GM glufosinate tolerant), compared to 1.13 kg/ha for conventional canola.
This analysis has been applied to the years to 2004. From 2005, the conventional
‘alternative’ used includes the comparison of ‘Clearfield’ canola, which makes up the
majority of the small are planted to non GM varieties 88. As in the US, in 2014, in terms
of active ingredient use, GM HT canola tolerant to glyphosate uses about 0.1kg/ha more
and GM HT canola tolerant to glufosinate uses about 0.63 kg/ha less than the
conventional alternative;
The average field EIQ/ha load for GM HT canola has been consistently lower than the
conventional counterpart (eg, in 2014, 17.74/ha for GM glyphosate tolerant canola,
8.8/ha for GM glufosinate tolerant canola and 22.89/ha for conventional canola);
On the basis of these comparisons with conventional canola, the reduction in the
volume of herbicide used was 2.39 million kg (a reduction of 25%) in 2014. Since 1996,
the cumulative reduction in usage has been 19% (18.3 million kg);
In terms of the field EIQ load, the reduction in 2014 was 54% (80 million field EIQ units)
and over the period 1996-2014, the EIQ load factor fell by 31%.

c) Australia
Australia first allowed commercial planting of GM HT canola in 2008. Based on analysis of
Fischer & Tozer (2009) which examined the use of GM HT (to glyphosate) canola relative to
triazine tolerant (non GM) and ‘Clearfield’ canola, the average savings from adoption of the GM
HT system were 0.4 kg/ha of active ingredient use and a reduction in the average field EIQ/ha of
2.74/ha (when applied to the 2014 crop weighted by type of conventional canola the GM HT
replaced (ie, triazine tolerant or ‘Clearfields’)). At the national level in 2014, this resulted in a net
saving of 0.18 million kgs of active ingredient (a 4.6% saving across the total canola crop) and a
4.2% reduction in the associated environmental impact of herbicide use (as measured by the EIQ
indicator) on the Australian canola crop. Since 2008, the total herbicide active ingredient saving
arising from use of GM HT canola has been about 0.54 million kg of active ingredient (-2.8%),
with the EIQ load falling by 2.3%.
d) Summary of impact
In the countries where GM HT canola has been adopted, there has been a net decrease in both the
volume of herbicides applied to canola and the environmental impact applied to the crop (Figure
18). More specifically:
•

•

In 2014, total herbicide ai use was 19% lower (2.7 million kg) than the level of use if the
total crop had been planted to conventional non GM varieties. The EIQ load was also
lower by 39%;
Cumulatively since 1996, the volume of herbicide ai applied was 17% lower than its
conventional equivalent (a saving of 21.8 million kg). The EIQ load had been reduced by
29%.

4.1.6 GM HT sugar beet
The US
GM HT sugar beet was first planted on a small area in the US in 2007, and in 2014 accounted for
98% (454,780 ha) of the total US sugar beet crop. In terms of weed control, the use of this
technology has resulted in a switch in use from a number of selective herbicides to glyphosate.
Drawing on evidence from a combination of industry observers and the GfK dataset on pesticide
use, the analysis below summarises the environmental impact (see appendix 3 for details of the
typical conventional versus GM HT sugar beet treatment).
The switch to GM HT sugar beet has resulted in a net increase in the amount of herbicide active
ingredient used (about +0.33 kg/ha 2007-2009, +0.58 kg/ha in 2010, +0.82kg/ha in 2011, +0.87kg/ha
in 2012 and +0.8 kg/ha in 2013 and 2014), but a decrease in the field EIQ/ha value of 5.4/ha 20072009 and 1.6/ha in 2010. In 2011-2014, the EIQ ratings were respectively -2/ha, -2.8/ha and -2.3/ha
(2013-14: a marginal deterioration). As a result, the 2014 impact of use of the technology was an
increase in the volume of herbicide ai applied of 365,000 kg (+41%) and an increase in the
associated environmental load, as measured by the EIQ indicator of 6.5%. Cumulatively, since
2007 there has been additional use of 2 million kg of ai and a similar associated environmental
impact of herbicides used on the US sugar beet crop (as measured by the EIQ indicator) as
conventional sugar beet.
GM HT sugar beet is also planted on a small area (about 15,000 ha in 2014) in Canada. Due to the
lack of publicly available data on sugar beet herbicide use in Canada, no environmental impact
analysis is presented. The impact is likely to be similar to the impact in the US.

4.1.7 GM IR maize
a) The US
Since 1996, when GM IR maize was first used commercially in the US, the average volume of
insecticide use targeted at stalk boring and rootworm pests has fallen (Table 55). Whilst levels of
insecticide ai use have fallen on both conventional and GM IR maize, usage by GM IR growers
has consistently been lower than their conventional counterparts (with the exception of 2008). A
similar pattern has occurred in respect of the average field EIQ value. This data therefore
suggests both that insecticide use per se has fallen on the US maize crops over the last nineteen
years and that usage on GM IR crops has fallen by a greater amount. However, examining the
impact of GM IR traits on insecticide use is more complex because:
•

There are a number of pests for the maize crop. These vary in incidence and damage by
region and year and typically affect only a proportion of the total crop. In the case of GM
IR maize, this comprises two main traits that target stalk boring pests and the corn
rootworm (second generation events have also included protection against cutworms
and earworms). In the US, typically, a maximum of about 10% of the crop was treated
with insecticides for stalk boring pests each year and about 30% of the US maize area
treated with insecticides for corn rootworm. This means that assessing the impact of the
GM IR technology requires disaggregation of insecticide usage specifically targeted at
these pests and limiting the maximum impact area to the areas that would otherwise
require insecticide treatment, rather than necessarily applying insecticide savings to the
entire area planted to seed containing GM IR traits targeting these pests. This is

•

•

particularly relevant if conclusions are to be drawn from examination of insecticide usage
changes overall and of the proportion of the US maize crop typically receiving treatments
of insecticides. Of note here has been the significant increase in the proportion of the US
maize crop that has technically been in receipt of insecticides in terms of ‘area treated’
(equally applicable to GM IR and conventional crops) over the last 7-10 years. This
reflects the growing preference by farmers for sowing maize seed that has been treated
with the insecticides clothiandin and thiamethoxam and is unrelated to the adoption of
GM IR technology;
Typically, the first users of the GM IR technology will be those farmers who regularly
experience economic levels of damage from the GM IR target pests. This means that once
the level of adoption (in terms of areas planted to the GM IR traits) is in excess of the
areas normally treated with insecticide sprays for these pests, it is likely that additional
areas planted to the traits are largely for insurance purposes and no additional insecticide
savings would arise (if assumed across all of the GM IR area). Secondly, comparing the
level of insecticide use on the small conventional crop with insecticide use on the GM IR
area would probably understate the insecticide savings, because the small conventional
farmers tend to be those who do not suffer the pest problems that are the target of the
GM IR technology and hence do not spray their crops with appropriate insecticide
treatments;
The widespread adoption of GM IR maize technology has also resulted in ‘area-wide’
suppression of target pests such as stalk borers in maize crops. As a result, conventional
farmers have benefited from this lower level of pest infestation and the associated
reduced need to conduct insecticide treatments (see for example, Hutchison et al (2010)).

In order to address these issues, our approach has been to first identify the insecticides typically
used to treat the stalk boring and rootworm pests and their usage rates from the GfK database
and relevant literature (eg, Carpenter & Gianessi (1999)). These sources identified average usage
of insecticides for the control of stalk boring pests and rootworm at 0.59 kg/ha (0.35 kg/ha from
2006 89) and 0.4 kg/ha respectively. The corresponding field EIQ/ha values are 20/ha for stalk
boring pests (10/ha from 2006) and 20.5/ha for rootworm.
88F

These active ingredient and field EIQ savings were then applied to the maximum of the area
historically receiving insecticide spray treatments for stalk boring pests and corn rootworm (10%
and 30% respectively of the US maize crop) or the GM IR area targeting these pests, whichever
was the smaller of the two areas. The maximum area to which these changes was applied in
respect of rootworm insecticide savings was also reduced from 2011 in line with the increase in
the area of the GM IR crop receiving applications of insecticides commonly used to target
rootworm pests that reflect practices adopted by some farmers concerned that rootworm pests
might be developing resistance to some of the GM IR traited seed (eg, in 2014, the maximum area
on which the rootworm insecticide savings was 30% of the crop total less 0.36 million ha).
Based on this approach, at the national level, the use of GM IR maize has resulted in an annual
saving in the volume of insecticide ai use of 79% (of the total usage of insecticides typically
targeted at both corn boring pests and corn rootworm) in 2014 (5.1 million kg) and the annual
field EIQ load fell by 81% in 2014 (equal to 233 million field EIQ/ha units). Since 1996, the

cumulative decrease in insecticide ai use targeted at these pests has been 47% (61.6 million kg),
and the cumulative reduction in the field EIQ load has been 49% (Table 56).

b) Canada
As in the US, the main impact has been associated with reduced use of insecticides. Based on
analysis of a typical insecticide treatment regime targeted at corn boring pests prior to the
introduction of GM IR technology that is now no longer required 90, this has resulted in a farm
level saving of 0.43 kg/ha of ai use and a reduction of the field EIQ/ha of 20.7/ha. Applying this
saving to the area devoted to GM IR maize in 1997 and then to a maximum of 5% of the total
Canadian maize area in any subsequent year, the cumulative reduction in insecticide ai use
targeted at stalk boring pests has been 668,000 kg (-88%). In terms of environmental load, the
total EIQ/ha load has fallen by 18.3 million units (-62%) 91.
89F

90F

c) Spain
Analysis for Spain draws on insecticide usage data from the early years of GM IR trait adoption,
when the areas planted with this trait were fairly low (1999-2001 – from Brookes (2002)), and
restricts the estimation of insecticide savings to a maximum of 10% of the total maize crop area
which may have otherwise received insecticide treatments for corn boring pests. The difference
in the data presented for Spain relative to the other countries is that the changes identified in
insecticide usage relate to total insecticide use rather than insecticides typically used to target
stalk boring pests. As a result of the adoption of GM IR maize, there has been a net decrease in
both the volume of insecticide used and the field EIQ/ha load 92. More specifically:
91F

•

•

The volume of total maize insecticide ai use was 45% lower than the level would
probably have been if the entire crop had been conventional in 2014 (-39,700 kg). Since
1998 the cumulative saving (relative to the level of use if all of the crop had been
conventional) was 544,000 kg of insecticide ai (a 36% decrease);
The field EIQ/ha load has fallen by 21% since 1999 (-14.6 million units). In 2014, the field
EIQ load was 25% lower than its conventional equivalent.

d) Argentina
Although GM IR maize has been grown commercially in Argentina since 1998, the environmental
impact of the technology has been very small. This is because insecticides have not traditionally
been used on maize in Argentina (the average expenditure on all insecticides has only been $1$2/ha), and very few farmers have used insecticides targeted at stalk boring pests. This absence
of conventional treatments reflects several reasons including poor efficacy of the insecticides, the
need to get spray timing right (at time of corn borer hatching, otherwise insecticides tend to be

And limiting the national impact to 5% of the total maize crop in Canada – the estimated maximum area that probably received
insecticide treatments targeted at corn boring pests before the introduction of GM IR maize
91
This relates to the total insecticide usage that would otherwise have probably been used on the Canadian maize crop to combat corn
boring pests

ineffective once the pest has bored into the stalk), seasonal and annual variations in pest pressure
and lack of awareness as to the full level of yield damage inflicted by the pest. As indicated in
section 3, the main benefits from using the technology have been significantly higher levels of
average yield, reduced production risk and improved quality of grain.
e) South Africa
Due to the limited availability of insecticide usage data in South Africa, the estimates of the
impact of GM IR maize in South Africa presented below are based on the following assumptions:
Irrigated crops are assumed to use two applications of cypermethrin to control stalk
boring pests. This equates to about 0.168 kg/ha of active ingredient and a field EIQ of
6.11/ha (applicable to area of 200,000 ha);
A dry land crop area of about 1,768,000 ha is assumed to receive an average of one
application of cypermethrin. This amounts to 0.084 kg/ha of active ingredient and has a
field EIQ of 3.06/ha;
The first 200,000 ha to adopt GM IR technology is assumed to be irrigated crops.

•

•

•

Based on these assumptions:
In 2014, the adoption of GM IR maize resulted in a net reduction in the volume of
insecticides used of 165,300 kg (relative to the volume that would probably have been
used if 1.768 million ha had been treated with insecticides targeted at stalk boring pests).
The EIQ load (in respect of insecticide use targeted at these pests) was 100% lower than it
would otherwise have been in the absence of use of the GM IR technology);
Cumulatively since 2000, the reductions in the volume of ai use and the associated
environmental load from sprayed insecticides were both 66% (1.6 million kg ai).

•

•

f) Brazil
The GM IR maize area in Brazil, in 2014, was 11.9 million ha (first planted commercially in 2008).
Various stalk boring and other pests are commonplace in the Brazilian maize crop, with the Fall
Armyworm (Spodoptera) being a major pest, and approximately 50% of the total annual crop has
regularly been treated with insecticides targeting this pest (typically five spray treatments/crop).
The availability of GM IR maize that targets this pest has allowed users to decrease the number of
insecticide spray runs from about five to two and significantly reduce the use of insecticides such
as methomyl, lufenuron, triflumuron, spinosad and thiodicarb. As a result, the typical average
saving in active ingredient use has been 0.356 kg/ha and the field EIQ/ha saving has been
21.5/ha 93. Applying these savings to the national level (constrained to a maximum of 48% of the
total maize crop that has been the historic average annual area receiving insecticide treatments),
this resulted in 2.7 million kg of insecticide active ingredient saving in 2014. This represents a
100% reduction in the environmental impact associated with insecticide use targeted at these
pests. Cumulatively, over the seven years of use, the ai and field EIQ savings have been 87%
lower than they would otherwise have been if this technology had not been used (a saving of 15.2
million kg of ai).

g) Colombia
The GM IR area in Colombia in 2014 was 66,800 ha (first grown in 2009). Based on analysis by
Mendez et al (2011), this estimates that conventional maize growers (in the San Juan valley)
typically use 0.56 kg/ai of insecticide to control maize pests, with an average field EIQ of 15.89/ha.
Applying these savings to the GM IR area in 2009-2014, the technology has contributed to a
saving in insecticide active ingredient use of 0.15 million kg. In terms of both active ingredient
use and EIQ rating, this represents about a 63% reduction.
h) Other countries
GM IR maize has also been grown on significant areas in the Philippines (since 2003: 602,000 ha
planted in 2014), in Uruguay (since 2004: 76,300 ha in 2014), in Honduras (since 2003: 29,000 ha in
2014) and in Paraguay (since 2013, 500,000 ha in 2014). Due to limited availability on insecticide
use on maize crops 94, it has not been possible to analyse the impact of reduced insecticide use and
the associated environmental impact in these countries.

insecticide use and the associated environmental load (relative to what could have been expected
if all maize plantings had been to conventional varieties) have been (Figure 19):
•

In 2014, a 71% decrease in the total volume of insecticide ai applied (8 million kg) and
an 88.7% reduction in the environmental impact (measured in terms of the field EIQ/ha
load 95);
Since 1996, 51.6% less insecticide ai has been used (79.7 million kg) and the
environmental impact from insecticides applied to the maize crop has fallen by 55.7%.

4.1.8 GM insect resistant (GM IR) cotton
a) The US
Whilst the annual average volume of insecticides used on the US cotton crop has fluctuated (as to
be expected according to variations in regional and yearly pest pressures), there has been an
underlying decrease in usage (Figure 20). Applications on GM IR crops and the associated
environmental impact have also been consistently lower for most years until 2007. Drawing
conclusions from the usage data for the conventional versus GM IR cotton alone should,
however, be treated with caution for a number of reasons (see also section 4.1.7):
•

There are a number of pests for the cotton crop. These vary in incidence and damage by
region and year and may affect only a proportion of the total crop. In the case of GM IR
cotton, this comprises traits that target various Heliothis and Helicoverpa pests (eg,
budworm and bollworm). These are major pests of cotton crops in all cotton growing
regions of the world (including the US) and can devastate crops, causing substantial
reductions in yield, unless crop protection practices are employed. In the US, all of the
crop may typically be treated with insecticides for Heliothis/Helicoverpa pests each year
although in some regions, notably Texas, the incidence and frequency of pest pressure
tends to be much more limited than in other regions. In addition, there are pests such as
boll weevil which are not targeted by current GM IR traits and crops receive insecticide
treatments for these pests. This means that assessing the impact of the GM IR cotton
technology requires disaggregation of insecticide usage specifically targeted at the
Heliothis/Helicoverpa pests, and possibly limiting the maximum impact area to the areas
that would otherwise require insecticide treatment, rather than necessarily applying
insecticide savings to the entire area planted to seed containing GM IR traits targeting
these pests;

GM crop impact: 1996-2014

•

•

The widespread adoption of GM insect resistant technology has resulted in ‘area-wide’
suppression of target pests such as some Heliothis/Helicoverpa pests in cotton crops. As a
result, some conventional farmers have benefited from this lower level of pest infestation
and the associated reduced need to conduct insecticide treatments (Wu et al (2008));
Typically, the first users of the GM IR technology will be those farmers who regularly
experience economic levels of damage from the GM IR target pests. This means that once
the levels of adoption (in terms of areas planted to the GM IR traits) become significant
(above 50% of the US crop from 2005, and 84% in 2014), it is likely that the residual
conventional crop tends to be found in regions where the pest pressure and damage from
Heliothis/Helicoverpa pests is lower than would otherwise be the case in the regions where
GM IR traits have been adopted. Hence, using data based on the average insecticide use
on this residual conventional crop as an indicator of insecticide use savings relating to the
adoption of GM IR traits probably understates the insecticide savings.

In order to address these issues, our approach has been to first identify the insecticides typically
used to treat the Heliothis/Helicoverpa pests and their usage rates from the GfK database and
relevant literature (eg, Carpenter & Gianessi (1999), Sankala & Blumenthal (2003 & 2006)). This
identified average usage of a number of insecticides commonly used for the control of these pests
in terms of amount of active ingredient applied, field eiq/ha values and the proportion of the total
crop receiving each active ingredient in a baseline period of 1996-2000. As most of these
insecticide active ingredients are still in use in 2014 (for control of some other pests than those
targeted by the GM IR trait), we have calculated the potential maximum usage of each insecticide
for each year under the assumption no GM IR technology was used (using the baseline 1996-2000
adoption rates) and then compared these levels of use with actual recorded usage in each year.
The difference between the two values represents the savings in insecticide usage attributed to
the GM IR technology. Thus the annual savings estimated have been between 0.21 kg/ha and
0.85 kg/ha of active ingredient use and the field EIQ savings have been between 7.76/ha and
18/ha. In 2014, the savings were at the higher end of this range (0.9 kg/ai/ha and the field eiq
saving of 19/ha). These active ingredient and field EIQ savings were then applied to the GM IR
area targeting these pests.
At the national level, the use of GM IR cotton has resulted in an annual saving in the volume of
insecticide ai use of 57% in 2014 (2.8 million kg) and the annual field EIQ load on the US cotton
crop also fell by 29.7% in 2014 (equal to 59 million field EIQ/ha units). Since 1996, the cumulative
decrease in insecticide ai use has been 21.6% (17 million kg), and the cumulative reduction in the
field EIQ load has been 17.9% (Table 57).

GM crop impact: 1996-2014

b) China
Since the adoption of GM IR cotton in China there have been substantial reductions in the use of
insecticides. In terms of the average volume of insecticide ai applied to cotton, the application to
a typical hectare of GM IR cotton in the earlier years of adoption was about 1.35 kg/ha, compared
to 6.02 kg/ha for conventionally grown cotton (a 77% decrease) 96. In terms of an average field
EIQ load/ha the GM IR cotton insecticide load was 61/ha compared to 292/ha for conventional
cotton. More recent assessments of these comparisons (see Appendix 3 for 2014) put the average
conventional treatment at 3.48 kg/ha, with a field EIQ/ha of 122.5/ha, compared to 2.1 kg/ha and a
field EIQ/ha of 87.0/ha for GM IR cotton.
95F

Based on these differences, the amount of insecticide ai used and its environmental load impact
were respectively 36,7% and 27% lower in 2014 (Table 58) than the levels that would have
occurred if only conventional cotton had been planted. Cumulatively since 1997, the volume of
insecticide use has decreased by 30.5% (123.5 million kg ai) and the field EIQ load has fallen by
30.6% (5.8 billion field EIQ/ha units).

There has been a significant reduction in both the volume of insecticides used and the
environmental impact associated with this spraying (Table 59);
The average field EIQ/ha value of the Ingard technology was less than half the average
field EIQ/ha for conventional cotton. In turn, this saving has been further increased with
the availability and adoption of the Bollgard II cotton from 2003/04;
The total amount of insecticide ai used and its environmental impact (Table 60) has been
respectively 52% (0.23 million kg) and 57% lower in 2014 than the levels that would have
occurred if only conventional cotton had been planted;
Cumulatively, since 1996 the volume of insecticide use is 33.2% lower (18 million kg)
than the amount that would have been used if GM IR technology had not been adopted
and the field EIQ load has fallen by 34.2%.

Adoption of GM IR cotton in Argentina has also resulted in important reductions in insecticide
use 98:

•
•
•

•

The average volume of insecticide ai used by GM IR cotton growers is 36.4% lower than
the average of 0.736 kg/ha for conventional cotton growers in 2014;
The average field EIQ/ha is also significantly lower for GM IR cotton growers (38.2/ha for
conventional growers compared to 15.1/ha for GM IR growers);
The total amount of ai used and its environmental impact (Table 61) have been
respectively 39% (118,000 kg) and 53% lower (8.3 million field EIQ/ha units in 2014) than
the levels that would have occurred if only conventional cotton had been planted;

GM crop impact: 1996-2014

•

GM IR cotton: average volume of insecticide used was 0.68 kg/ha and a field EIQ/ha
value of 18.85/ha.

Based on these values, the level of insecticide ai use and the total EIQ load in 2014 were
respectively 56% (12.6 million kg) and 69% (654 million field EIQ/ha units) lower than would
have been expected if the total crop had been conventional cotton. Cumulatively, since 2002, the
insecticide ai use was 26.7% lower (87 million kg) and the total EIQ load 34.3% lower (4.2 billion
EIQ/ha units).
f) Brazil
GM IR cotton was first planted commercially in 2006 (in 2014, on 330,000 ha, 32% of the total
crop). Due to the limited availability of data, the analysis presented below is based on the
experience in Argentina (see above). Thus, the respective differences for insecticide ai use and
field EIQ values for GM IR and conventional cotton used as the basis for the analysis are:
•
•

Conventional cotton: average volume of insecticide used is 0.736 kg/ha and a field EIQ/ha
value of 38.2/ha;
GM IR cotton: average volume of insecticide used 0.41 kg/ha and a field EIQ/ha value of
15.1/ha.

Using these values, the level of insecticide ai use and the total EIQ load in 2014 were respectively
16% (107,000 kg) and 20% (7.6 million EIQ/ha units) lower than would have been expected if the
total crop had been conventional cotton. Cumulatively since 2006, the total active ingredient
saving has been 0.88 million kg (11%) and the EIQ/ha load factor has fallen by 14%.
g) Mexico
GM IR cotton has been grown in Mexico since 1996, and in 2014, 99,870 ha (55% of the total crop)
were planted to varieties containing GM IR traits.
Drawing on industry level data that compares typical insecticide treatments for GM IR and
conventional cotton (see appendix 3), the main environmental impact associated with the use of
GM IR technology in the cotton crop has been a significant reduction in the environmental impact
associated with insecticide use on cotton. More specifically:
•

•

•

On a per ha basis, GM IR cotton uses 31% less (-1.6 kg) insecticide than conventional
cotton. The associated environmental impact, as measured by the EIQ indicator, of the
GM IR cotton is a 32% improvement on conventional cotton (a field EIQ/ha value of
56.6/ha compared to 137/ha for conventional cotton);
In 2014, at a national level, there had been a 17.2% saving in the amount of insecticide
active ingredient use (162,000 kg) applied relative to usage if the whole crop had been
planted to conventional varieties. The field EIQ load was 17% lower;
Cumulatively since 1996, the amount of insecticide active ingredient applied was 11.4%
(1.54 million kg) lower relative to usage if the Mexican cotton crop had been planted to
only conventional varieties over this period. The field EIQ load was 11.3% lower than it
would otherwise have been if the whole crop had been using conventional varieties.

h) Other countries
Cotton farmers in South Africa, Colombia, Burkina Faso, Pakistan, Myanmar and Sudan have
also been using GM IR technology in recent years. Analysis of the impact on insecticide use and
the associated environmental ‘foot print’ are not presented for these crops because of the lack of
insecticide usage data.
i) Summary of impact
Since 1996, the net impact on insecticide use and the associated environmental ‘foot print’
(relative to what could have been expected if all cotton plantings had been to conventional
varieties) in the main GM IR adopting countries has been (Figure 21):
•

•

In 2014, a 48.2% decrease in the total volume of insecticide ai applied (21.7 million kg)
and a 49.6% reduction in the environmental impact (measured in terms of the field
EIQ/ha load);
Since 1996, 27.9% less insecticide ai has been used (249.1 million kg) and the
environmental impact from insecticides applied to the cotton crop has fallen by 30.4%.

4.1.9 Other environmental impacts - development of herbicide resistant
weeds and weed shifts
As indicated in section 4.1.1, weed resistance to glyphosate has become a major issue affecting
some farmers using GM HT (tolerant to glyphosate) crops.
This resistance development should, however, be placed in context. All weeds have the ability to
develop resistance to all herbicides and there are hundreds of resistant weed species confirmed in

the International Survey of Herbicide Resistant Weeds (www.weedscience.org), and reports of
herbicide resistant weeds pre-date the use of GM HT crops by decades. There are, for example,
158 weed species that are resistant to ALS herbicides and 73 weed species resistant to
photosystem II inhibitor herbicides. Worldwide there are currently (accessed March 2016) 35
weeds species resistant to glyphosate of which several are not associated with glyphosate tolerant
crops (www.weedscience.org). In the US, there are currently 16 weeds recognised as exhibiting
resistance to glyphosate, of which two are not associated with glyphosate tolerant crops. In
Argentina, Brazil and Canada, where GM HT crops are widely grown, the number of weed
species exhibiting resistance to glyphosate are respectively 7, 7 and 5. A few of the glyphosateresistant species, such as marestail (Conyza canadensis), waterhemp (Amaranthus tuberculatus) and
palmer pigweed (Amaranthus palmeri) in the US, are now reasonably widespread, with the
affected area being possibly within a range of 30%-50% of the total area annually devoted to
maize, cotton and soybeans.
Where farmers are faced with the existence of weeds resistant to glyphosate in GM HT crops,
they are increasingly being advised to be more proactive and include other herbicides (with
different and complementary modes of action) in combination with glyphosate and in some cases
to revert to ploughing in their integrated weed management systems. This change in weed
management emphasis also reflects the broader agenda of developing strategies across all forms
of cropping systems to minimise and slow down the potential for weeds developing resistance to
existing technology solutions for their control. At the macro level, these changes have already
influenced the mix, total amount, cost and overall profile of herbicides applied to GM HT crops
in the last 7-10 years.
For example, in the 2014 US GM HT soybean crop, 74% of the GM HT soybean crop received an
additional herbicide treatment of one of the following (four most used, after glyphosate) active
ingredients 2,4-D (used pre crop planting), chlorimuron, flumioxazin and sulfentrazone (each
used primarily after crop planting). This compares with 14% of the GM HT soybean crop
receiving a treatment of one of these four herbicide active ingredients in 2006. As a result, the
average amount of herbicide active ingredient applied to the GM HT soybean crop in the US (per
hectare) increased by about 64% over this period. The increase in non-glyphosate herbicide use is
primarily in response to public and private sector weed scientist recommendations to diversify
weed management programmes and not to rely on a single herbicide mode of action for total
weed management. It is interesting to note that in 2014, glyphosate accounted for a lower share
of total active ingredient use on the GM HT crop (73%) as in 1998 when it accounted for 82% of
total active ingredient use, highlighting that, although farmers are making additional use of non
glyphosate herbicides, they continue to realise value in using glyphosate because of its broad
spectrum activity. On the small conventional crop, the average amount of herbicide active
ingredient applied increased by 84% over the same period reflecting a shift in herbicides used
rather than increased dose rates for some herbicides. The increase in the use of herbicides on the
conventional soybean crop in the US can also be partly attributed to the on-going development of
weed resistance to non-glyphosate herbicides commonly used and highlights that the
development of weed resistance to herbicides is a problem faced by all farmers, regardless of
production method. It is also interesting to note that since the mid 2000s, the average amount of
herbicide active ingredient used on GM HT cotton in the US has increased through a combination
of additional usage of glyphosate (about a 30% increase in usage per hectare) in conjunction with
increasing use of other herbicides. All of the GM HT crop area planted to seed tolerant to
glyphosate received treatments of glyphosate and at least one of the next five most used

herbicides (trifluralin, acetochlor, S metolachlor, fomesafen and pendimethalin). This compares
with 2006, when only three-quarters of the glyphosate tolerant crop received at least one
treatment from the next five most used herbicides (2 4-D, trifluralin, pyrithiobic, pendimethalin
and diuron). In other words, a quarter of the glyphosate tolerant crop used only glyphosate for
weed control in 2006 compared to none of the crop relying solely on glyphosate in 2014. This
suggests that US cotton farmers are increasingly adopting current/recent recommended practices
for managing weed resistance (to glyphosate).
Relative to the conventional alternative, the environmental profile of GM HT crop use has,
nevertheless, continued to offer important advantages and in most cases, provides an improved
environmental profile compared to the conventional alternative (as measured by the EIQ
indicator).
In addition, control of volunteer herbicide resistant crops has also been addressed in the same
way, and few differences have been reported between volunteer management strategies in
conventional crops compared to GM HT crops (see for example, Canola Council (2005) relating to
volunteer canola management).

4.2 Carbon sequestration
This section assesses the contribution of GM crop adoption to reducing the level of greenhouse
gas (GHG) emissions. The three main GHGs of relevance to agriculture are carbon dioxide (CO2),
nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4). The scope for GM crops contributing to lowering levels
of GHG comes from three principal sources:
a) Reduced fuel use from fewer herbicide or insecticide applications (eg, targeted insecticide
programmes developed in combination with GM IR cotton where the number of
insecticide treatments has been significantly reduced and hence there are fewer
mechanical spray passes);
b) The use of ‘no-till’ (NT) and ‘reduced-till’ 99 (RT) farming systems collectively referred to
as conservation tillage, have increased significantly with the adoption of GM HT crops.
The GM HT technology has improved farmers’ ability to control weeds, reducing the
need to rely on soil cultivation and seed-bed preparation as means to getting good levels
of weed control. The advantages of conservation tillage include:
98F

•
•
•

Lower fuel costs (less ploughing);
Reduced labour requirements;
Enhanced soil quality and reduced levels of soil erosion, resulting in more carbon
remaining in soil, which leads to lower GHG emissions 100;
Improved levels of soil moisture conserving;
99 F

•

99
No-till farming means that the ground is not ploughed at all, while reduced tillage means that the ground is disturbed less than it
would be with traditional tillage systems. For example, under a no-till farming system, soybean seeds are planted through the organic
material that is left over from a previous crop such as corn, cotton or wheat, without any soil disturbance, whereas reduced tillage
would include ridge till, mulch till and reduced tillage (where 15-30% of plant residue is left on the soil surface after planting).
100
The International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has agreed that conservation/no till cultivation leads to higher levels of soil
carbon. http://www.ipcc.ch/ipccreports/sres/land_use/index.php?idp=174

c)

Reduced soil temperature fluctuations from the insulating properties of crop
residues. This has a positive impact on both the physical, chemical and
microbiological properties of soil (Mathew et al (2012)).

Additional carbon dioxide can be assimilated where the GM technology leads to higher
yields and levels of production (see section 4.2.11).

Overall, the reduction of GHGs can be measured in terms of the amount of carbon dioxide
removed from the atmosphere from reduced consumption of fuel and additional storing of
carbon in the soil with no/reduced tillage practices.

4.2.1 Tractor fuel use
a) Reduced and no tillage
The traditional intensive method of soil cultivation is based on the use of the mouldboard plough
followed by a range of seed bed preparations. However, this has been increasingly replaced in
the last 20 years by less intensive methods such as reduced tillage (RT: using reduced chisel or
disc ploughing) or conservation tillage (CT: mulch-till, ridge-till, strip-till, no till: NT). The RT
and NT systems rely much more on herbicide-based weed control, often comprising a pre-plant
burn-down application and secondary, post-emergent applications.
The adoption of conservation tillage systems, notably NT systems, have been facilitated by the
availability of GM HT crops. To estimate fuel savings from reduced tillage, we have reviewed
reports and data from a number of sources, of which the main ones were: the United States
Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) Energy Estimator for Tillage Model (2014), the Voluntary
Reporting of Greenhouse Gases-Management Evaluation Tool (COMET-VR), Reeder (2010) and
the University of Illinois (2006):

•

The USDA’s Energy Estimator for Tillage Model estimates diesel fuel use and costs in the
production of key crops by specific locations across the USA and compares potential
energy savings between conventional tillage (CT) and alternative tillage systems. The
quantity of tractor fuel used for seed-bed preparation, herbicide spraying and planting in
each of these systems is illustrated for soybeans planted in Illinois (Table 62).
Conventional tillage requires 49.01 litres/ha, compared to mulch till at 40.88 litres/ha,
ridge till 32.36 litres/ha and no-till 21.79 litres/ha;

The Voluntary Reporting of Greenhouse Gases-Carbon Management Evaluation Tool
(COMET-VR) gives a higher reduction of 41.81 litres/ha when conventional tillage is
replaced by no-till on non-irrigated corn and a reduction of 59.68 litres/ha in the case of
soybeans in Nebraska;
The University of Illinois (2006) compared the relative fuel use across four different
tillage systems for both corn and soybeans. The ‘deep’ tillage and ‘typical’ intensive
systems required 36.01 litres/ha compared to the strip-till and no-till systems which used
22.92 litres/ha – a reduction of 13.09 litres/ha;
Reeder (2010) estimated that RT or NT typically uses 19 to 38 litres/ha less diesel fuel than
conventional tillage;
Analysis by the Jasa (2002) at the University of Nebraska calculated fuel use based on
farm survey data for various crops and tillage systems. Intensive tillage (resulting in 0%15% crop residue) using the mouldboard plough uses 49.39 litres/ha, reduced tillage
(15%-30% residue) based on a chisel plough and/or combination of disk passes uses
28.34-31.24 litres/ha, conservation tillage (>30% residue) based on ridge tillage 25.16
litre/ha and no-till and strip-tillage 13.38 litres/ha - a reduction of 36.01 litres/ha
compared to intensive tillage;

These figures differ from ones presented in previous reports because the USDA Energy Estimator is regularly updated

GM crop impact: 1996-2014

Other analysts have suggested similar savings in fuel from no-till. For example, the
USDA 2007 Farm Bill Theme Paper ‘Energy and Agriculture’ stated: ‘During the past
couple of decades, the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) has helped farmers adopt
no-till practices on about 25 million hectares of cropland. Assuming an average saving of 33.13
litres/ha in diesel fuel, this amounts to savings of 821 million litres of diesel fuel per year with cost
savings to farmers of about $500 million per year.’

•

In our analysis 102 presented below, it is assumed that the adoption of NT farming systems in
soybean production reduces cultivation and seedbed preparation fuel usage by 27.12 litres/ha
compared with traditional conventional tillage and in the case of RT cultivation by 10.39 litres/ha.
In the case of maize, NT results in a saving of 24.41 litres/ha and in the case of RT 7.52 litres/ha,
compared with conventional intensive tillage. These are conservative estimates and are in line
with the USDA Fuel Estimator for soybeans and maize. The amount of tractor fuel used for seedbed preparation, herbicide spraying and planting in each of these systems is shown in Table 64.

In terms of GHG, each litre of tractor diesel consumed contributes an estimated 2.67 103 kg of
carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. The adoption of NT and RT systems in respect of fuel use
therefore results in reductions of carbon dioxide emissions of 72.41 kg/CO2/ha and 27.74
kg/CO2/ha respectively for soybeans and 65.17 kg/CO2/ha and 20.08 kg/CO2/ha for maize.
102F

b) Reduced application of herbicides and insecticides
For both herbicide and insecticide spray applications, the quantity of energy required to apply
pesticides depends upon the application method. For example, in the US, a typical method of
application is with a 50-foot boom sprayer which consumes approximately 0.84 litres/ha 104
(Lazarus (2013)). One less spray application therefore reduces carbon dioxide emissions by 2.24
kg/ha 105. Approximately 20% of pesticides in the US are applied by crop dusters which have a
marginally lower carbon footprint than boom sprayers (National Agricultural Aviation
Association 2013).

102

In previous editions of this report, the authors have used different savings that reflect changing estimates of fuel use by the USDA
Energy Estimator. In reports covering the period up to 2010 savings of 27.22 litres/ha for NT and 9.56 litres/ha for RT compared to
CT were used
103
In previous editions of this report the authors have applied a co-efficient of 2.75 to convert 1 litre of diesel to kgs of carbon dioxide.
This report (and the reports covering the period 1996-2011, 1996-2012 and 1996-2013) uses the updated figure of 2.6676 rounded to
2.67.
104
In previous editions of this report (up to and including the 5th report covering 1996-2009) the authors have used 1.31 litres/ha.
105
Given that many farmers apply insecticides via sprayers pulled by tractors, which tend to use higher levels of fuel than selfpropelled boom sprayers, the estimates used in this section (for reductions in carbon emissions), which are based on self-propelled
boom application, probably understate the carbon benefits.

GM crop impact: 1996-2014

The conversion of one hectare of conventional tillage to no-till equates to a saving of
approximately 483 km travelled by a standard family car 106 and one less spray pass per hectare is
equal to a saving of nearly 15 km travelled.
105 F

4.2.2 Soil carbon sequestration
The use of RT/NT farming systems increases the amount of organic soil carbon in the form of
crop residue that is stored or sequestered in the soil and therefore reduces carbon dioxide
emissions to the environment. Appendix 5 summarises some of the key research which has
examined the relationship between carbon sequestration and different tillage systems. This
literature review shows that the amount of carbon sequestered varies by soil type, cropping
system, eco-region and tillage depth. It also shows that tillage systems can impact on levels of
other GHG emissions such as methane and nitrous oxide and on crop yield.
Overall, the literature highlights the difficulty in estimating the contribution NT/RT systems can
make to soil carbon sequestration, because of the dynamic nature of soils, climate, cropping types
and patterns. If a specific crop area is in continuous NT crop rotation, the full soil carbon
sequestration benefits described in the literature can be realised. However, if the NT crop area is
returned to a conventional tillage system, a proportion of the soil organic carbon gain will be lost.
The temporary nature of this form of carbon storage only becomes permanent when farmers
adopt a continuous NT system, which, as indicated earlier, is highly dependent upon having
effective herbicide-based weed control systems.
Complex models are available to estimate the level of carbon sequestered depending upon
historic, present and future cropping systems. For example, the USDA’s COMET-Planner applies
emission reduction coefficients for changes in tillage practice from conventional tillage to NT and
RT based on a meta-analysis of the literature on the subject (Table 65). In this tool coefficients are
generalized at the national-scale and differentiated by dry and humid climate zones with the
values shown being emission reductions relative to baseline management (positive values mean a
decrease in emissions due to the implementation of the tillage practice). For example, the
conversion of one hectare of crop land from CT to NT in a moist/humid environment will result
in 1,037.8 kg of carbon dioxide/ha/year being sequestered; this is equivalent to 282.8 kg
carbon/ha/year.

Our analysis for the US uses the COMET-VR 2.0 tool 107 for three key soybean and corn
production states and assumes the adoption of NT from CT in all states, a clay loam soil with
average fertiliser usage, a non-irrigated corn-soybean rotation in Minnesota and Illinois and a
soybean-corn-winter-wheat rotation in South Dakota. Using the COMET-VR 2.0 tool, the level of
carbon sequestered estimated to be stored is higher with NT by 117.5, 114.4 and 112.9 kg
carbon/ha/year respectively compared to the CT system for each of the three states for the
projected period 2013-2023.
106F

Analysis using the Michigan State University - US Cropland Greenhouse Gas Calculator 108 for
corn-soybean rotations in the same locations over a ten year projected period estimated that NT
sequesters an additional 123 kg carbon/ha/year compared to RT and 175 kg carbon/ha/year
compared to CT.
107F

Analysis of individual crops using the Michigan State University - US Cropland Greenhouse Gas
indicates that NT corn is a net carbon sink of 244 kg carbon/ha/year whereas NT soybean is a
marginal net source of carbon of 43 kg carbon/ha/year. The difference between corn NT and CT
is 247 kg carbon/ha/year and for soybeans 103 kg carbon/ha/year (Table 66).

Differences in carbon soil sequestration rates between corn and soybeans can be explained by the
greater plant matter residue contribution of the corn crop in the soybean-corn rotation. Research
by Alvarez & Steinbach (2012) estimated that corn/maize contributes 7,178 Mg/ha/year of dry
matter as crop residue compared to soybeans which contribute less (by 50%) at 3,373 Mg/ha/year.
In sum, drawing on these models and the literature discussed in Appendix 5, the analysis
presented in the following sub-sections assumes the following:

US: In previous editions of this report (up to 1996-2011) no differentiation was made between
corn and soybeans. The assumptions used were based on research as discussed earlier and uses
differences between NT and CT of 400 kg of carbon/ha/year of soil carbon sequestered (NT
systems store 375 kg of carbon/ha/year; RT systems store 175 kg of carbon/ha/year; and CT
systems store 25 kg of carbon/ha/year). In this report (and the previous three), the soil carbon
sequestered by tillage system for corn in continuous rotation with soybeans is assumed to be a
net sink of 250 kg of carbon/ha/year based on:
•
•
•

NT systems store 251 kg of carbon/ha/year;
RT systems store 75 kg of carbon/ha/year;
CT systems store 1 kg of carbon/ha/year.

The soil carbon sequestered by tillage system for soybeans in a continuous rotation with corn is
assumed to be a net sink of 100 kg of carbon/ha/year based on:
•
•
•

NT systems release 45 kg of carbon/ha/year;
RT systems release 115 kg of carbon/ha/year;
CT systems release 145 kg of carbon/ha/year.

South America (Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay): soil carbon retention is 175 kg
carbon/ha/year for NT soybean cropping and CT systems release 25 kg carbon/ha/year (a
difference of 200 kg carbon/ha/year). In previous editions of this report (1996-2012 and 1996-2013) the difference used was 300 kg carbon/ha/year.
Where the use of biotech crops has resulted in a reduction in the number of spray passes or the
consistent use of less intensive cultivation practices (less ploughing) this has provided (and
continues to provide) a permanent reduction in carbon dioxide emissions.

4.2.3 Herbicide tolerance and conservation tillage
The adoption of GM HT crops has impacted on the type of herbicides applied, the method of
application (foliar, broadcast, soil incorporated) and the number of herbicide applications. For
example, the adoption of GM HT canola in North America has resulted in applications of residual
soil-active herbicides being replaced by post-emergence applications of broad-spectrum
herbicides with foliar activity (Brimner et al (2004)). Similarly, in the case of GM HT cotton the
use of glyphosate to control both grass and broadleaf weeds, post-emergent, largely replaced the
use of soil residual herbicides applied pre- and post-emergence (McClelland et al (2000)). The
type and number of herbicide applications have therefore changed, sometimes (but not always)
resulting in a reduction in the number of herbicide applications (see section 3).
In addition to the possible reduction in the number of herbicide applications there has been a
shift from conventional tillage to reduced-till and no-till. This has had a marked effect on tractor
fuel consumption due to energy intensive cultivation methods being replaced with no/reduced
tillage and herbicide-based weed control systems. The GM HT crop where this is most evident is
GM HT soybeans. Here, adoption of the technology has made an important contribution to
facilitating the adoption of reduced or no tillage farming 109. Before the introduction of GM HT
soybean cultivars, NT systems were practised by some farmers with varying degrees of success
108 F

109

using a number of herbicides. The opportunity for growers to control weeds with a non-residual
foliar herbicide as a “burn down” pre-seeding treatment, followed by a post-emergent treatment
when the soybean crop became established, has made the NT system more reliable, technically
viable and commercially attractive. These technical and cost advantages have contributed to the
rapid adoption of GM HT cultivars and a substantial increase in the NT soybean area in the US
(also more than a seven-fold increase in Argentina). In both countries, GM HT soybeans are
estimated to account for over 95% of the NT soybean crop area.

4.2.4 Herbicide tolerant soybeans
4.2.4.1 The US
The area of soybeans cultivated in the US has increased rapidly from 26 million ha in1996 to 33.4
million ha in 2014. Over the same period, the soybean area planted using conventional tillage fell
by 37.7% (from 7.5 million ha to 4.7 million ha), whilst the area planted using reduced-till, mulch
till and ridge till increased by 27.5% (from 10.7 million ha to 13.7 million ha) and the area planted
using no-till increased by 94.8% (from 7.7 million ha to 15 million ha).
The most rapid rate of adoption of the GM HT technology has been by farmers using NT systems
(GM HT cultivars accounting for an estimated 99% of total NT soybeans by 1999). This compares
with conventional tillage systems for soybeans where GM HT cultivars may account for up to
75% of total conventional tillage soybean plantings (Table 67).

The importance of GM HT soybeans in the adoption of a NT system has also been confirmed by
an American Soybean Association (ASA) study (2001) of conservation tillage. This study found
that the availability of GM HT soybeans facilitated and encouraged farmers to implement
reduced tillage practices; a majority of growers surveyed indicated that GM HT soybean
technology had been the factor of greatest influence in their adoption of reduced tillage practices.
a) Fuel consumption
Based on the soybean crop area planted by tillage system, type of seed planted (GM HT and
conventional) and applying the fuel usage consumption rates presented in section 4.2.1, the total
consumption of tractor fuel has increased by only 14.3% (135.7 million litres - 1996 to 2014: Table
68) while the area planted increased by 28.6%. Over the same period, the average fuel usage fell
11.2% (from 36.6 litres/ha to 32.5 litres/ha). A comparison of GM HT versus conventional
production systems shows that in 2014, the average tillage fuel consumption on the GM HT
planted area was 31.7 litres/ha compared to 45.6 litres/ha for the conventional crop.

The cumulative permanent reduction in tillage fuel use in US soybeans is summarised in Table
69. This amounted to a reduction in tillage fuel usage of 1,266 million litres which equates to a
reduction in carbon dioxide emission of 3,379 million kg.

b) Soil carbon sequestration
Based on the crop area planted by tillage system and type of seed planted (GM HT and
conventional) and using estimates of the soil carbon sequestered by tillage system for corn and
soybeans in continuous rotation; the soybean NT system is assumed to release 45 kg of
carbon/ha/year; the RT system releases 115 kg carbon/ha/year; and the CT system releases 145 kg
carbon/ha/year) 110.
109 F

Our estimates of total soil carbon sequestered for the US soybean crop over the 1996 to 2014
period are (Table 70):
•

•

A small aggregate increase of 259.1 million kg carbon/year (a release of 2,672 million kg
in 1996 compared to 2,931.3 million kg carbon/year in 2014). The largely reflects the 7.4
million ha increase in the area planted to soybeans over this period;
the average level of carbon released per ha decreased by 14.7% (15.2 kg carbon/ha/year)
from 102.9 to 87.7 kg carbon/ha/year.

110

The actual rate of soil carbon sequestered by tillage system is, however, dependent upon soil type, soil organic content, quantity
and type of crop residue, so these estimates are indicative averages

Cumulatively, since 1996 the increase in soil carbon sequestered due to the increase in RT and NT
in US soybean production systems has been 4,685 million kg of carbon which, in terms of carbon
dioxide emissions, equates to a saving of 17,194 million kg of carbon dioxide that would
otherwise have been released into the atmosphere (Table 71). Readers should note that this
estimate does not take into consideration the potential loss in carbon sequestration that may arise
if some of the land using RT/NT is returned to conventional tillage.

4.2.4.2 Argentina
Since 1996, the area planted to soybeans in Argentina, has increased from 5.91 to 19.78 million ha
(+235%). Over the same period, the area planted using NT practices also increased substantially
from 2.15 to 17.6 million ha, whilst the area planted using conventional tillage decreased from
3.76 to 2.18 million ha (Table 72).
As in the US, a key driver for the growth in NT soybean production has been the availability of
GM HT soybean cultivars, which in 2014 accounted for 99.5% of the total Argentine soybean area.
The most important reasons for the adoption of GM HT soybean cultivars in Argentina were
examined by Finger et al (2009: based on a survey of Argentine soybean growers). This
concluded that the combination of herbicide tolerance and NT were the key drivers to adoption
of GM HT soybeans, facilitating easier crop management and reducing herbicide costs. As
indicated in section 3, the availability of this technology has also provided an opportunity for
growers to ‘second crop soybeans’ in a NT system with wheat. Thus, whereas in early to mid
1990s when 5%-10% of the total soybean crop was a second crop following on from wheat (in the
same season), in the last ten years the second crop soybean area has been within a range of 15%30% of the total soybean area (the maximum each year influenced by the total area planted to
wheat). During the 1990s and early 2000s, NT stimulated an increase in the soybean-maize
rotation which reduced insect pressure, restored soil organic matter (SOM), and increased crop
residue input and nutrient cycling. More recently the soybean-maize rotation has increasingly
been replaced by a soybean-soybean monoculture rotation due to the high costs of growing
maize which is more vulnerable to drought (Wingeyer et al, (2015)). With the area planted to
maize having increased from 2.5 million ha in the mid-1990s to 6.0 million ha in 2014 the use of
maize and other cover crops in the soybean rotation is resulting in a more sustainable approach
to soil management.
It should also be noted that the Argentine No-Till Farmers Association (AAPRESID) estimated in
the early 1990s, that NT farming had helped to reduce soil erosion by 90% (from about 10+
tonnes/ha of soil loss to about 1 tonne/ha) and contributed to additional water accumulated in the
top four inches (8.8 cm) of soil. This was also estimated to have contributed to higher crop yields
of up to 11% as well as reducing fuel use and labour costs.

a) Fuel consumption
Between 1996 and 2014 total fuel consumption associated with soybean cultivation increased by
82% from 231.5 to 492 million litres/year. However, during this period the average quantity of
fuel used per ha fell 36% from 39.1 to 24.9 litres/ha, due predominantly to the widespread use of
GM HT soybean cultivars and NT systems. If the proportion of NT soybeans in 2014 (applicable
to the total 2014 area planted) had remained at the 1996 level, an additional 2,941 million litres of
fuel would have been used. At this level of fuel usage, an additional 7,852 million kg of carbon
dioxide would otherwise have been released into the atmosphere (Table 73).

b) Soil carbon sequestration
Over the two decades to the late 1990s, soil degradation levels were reported to have increased in
the humid and sub-humid regions of Argentina. The main cause of this was attributed to leaving
land fallow following a wheat crop in a wheat/first soybean crop rotation. This resulted in soils
being relatively free of weeds and crop residues but exposed to heavy summer rains which often
led to extensive soil degradation and loss.
Research into ways of reducing soil degradation and loss was undertaken (mostly relating to the
use of NT systems 111) and this identified that NT systems could play an important role. As such,
in the last twenty years, there has been an intensive programme of research and technology
transfer targeted at encouraging Argentine growers to adopt NT systems.

Specific research into soil carbon sequestration in Argentina is limited, although Fabrizzi et al
(2003) indicated that a higher level of total organic carbon was retained in the soil with NT
system compared with a CT system, but no quantification was provided. Detailed research by
Steinbach (2006) modelled the impact on the conversion of the Argentinean Pampas to no-till to
mitigate the global warming effect. This work estimated that NT conversion would result in an
increase of soil organic carbon (SOC) of 74 million tonnes of carbon, about twice the annual
carbon emissions from fossil fuel consumed in Argentina. However, the report concluded that
the increased emissions of nitrous oxide might offset the carbon mitigation of no-till after 35
years. Derpsch et al (2010) estimates that two-thirds of the area under NT systems in South
America is permanently in NT, which in Argentina is over 70% of the NT crop area. This
suggests that these carbon sequestration gains are of a permanent nature.
Results from a 15-year experiment in the semi-arid Argentine Pampa to evaluate a combination of
three tillage systems (no tillage, no tillage with cover crop in winter and reduced tillage) and two
crop sequences (soybean–maize and soybean monoculture) concluded that NT tillage system had
a greater impact on total organic carbon (TOC) stock than crop sequence (Alvarez et al (2014)).
Total organic carbon stock, up to a depth of 100 cm showed signiﬁcant differences between soils
under different tillage systems (RT < NT = NT with cover crop), the last ones having 8% more
than the RT treatment. Soybean–maize had 3% more organic carbon up to 100 cm depth than the
soybean monoculture. Up to 100 cm depth, the NT treatments accumulated 333 kg TOC/ha/year
more than RT, while the soybean-maize sequence accumulated only 133 kg TOC/ha/year more
than soybean monoculture. At 0–30 cm depth, the NT treatments had 267 kg TOC/ha/year more
than the RT treatment.
Applying a conservative estimate of soil carbon retention of 175 kg carbon/ha/yr for NT and a
release of 25 kg carbon/ha/yr for CT soybean cropping in Argentina, a cumulative total of 21,687
111
Trials conducted by INTA found that direct sowing increases the yields of wheat and second soybean crop in rotation. Other
benefits observed were: less soil inversion leaving a greater quantity of stubble on the surface, improvements in hydraulic
conductivity, more efficient use of soil water, and higher soil organic matter contents.

4.2.4.3 Brazil
In earlier reports we excluded Brazil from the analysis of carbon savings associated with the
facilitating role of GM HT soybeans on the adoption of NT/RT systems in the Brazilian soybean
sector, largely because NT/RT systems were commonplace in the sector before the legal
availability of GM HT soybeans in 2003. However, after consultation with several analysts in
Brazil who have examined the factors influencing the adoption of NT/RT systems in Brazil, we
have partially included some of the Brazilian GM HT soybean area in the calculations of carbon
savings (included first in the report covering the period 1996-2010). This analysis includes the
area devoted to GM HT soybeans in the southern states of Santa Catarina, Paraná and Rio
Grande de Sol where the agricultural conditions are similar to those in Argentina and where the
availability of GM HT soybean technology is considered to have played an important role in
allowing farmers to adopt NT/RT systems.
From 1997 when GM HT soybeans were first planted in Brazil (illegally), the total area of GM HT
soybeans has increased from 0.1 million ha to 29.8 million ha in 2014, of which these southern
states accounted for 34.5% (11.07 million ha). The vast majority of soybean production in these
states uses NT systems (90%: 9.97 million ha), with virtually all of the NT area being GM HT
soybeans (Table 75).

a) Fuel consumption
The Brazilian Federation of ‘direct planting’ (FEBRAPDP) and the Brazilian Agricultural Research
Corporation (Embrapa) estimate that the conversion from CT to NT results in fuel savings of
between 60%-70% (Plataforma Plantio Direto (2006)). This compares with a 55% reduction in the
US (see section 4.2.4.1). In our analysis below, we adopt a conservative approach and apply the
fuel consumption rates used in the US (21.89 litres/ha for NT and 49.01 litres/ha for CT - a
reduction of 55% for NT relative to CT) to the GM HT soybean area planted in the three southern
Brazilian states.
As a result of the adoption of GM HT soybeans and their facilitating role in allowing farmers to
remain in NT, total fuel consumption associated with soybean cultivation (1997-2014) increased
by 7.7% from 253 to 272 million litres/year. During this period the average quantity of fuel used
per ha also fell 39.8% from 40.9 to 24.6 litres/ha. If the proportion of NT soybeans in 2014
(applicable to the total 2014 area planted in the three southern states) had remained at the 1997
level, an additional 1,591 million litres of fuel would have been used. At this level of fuel usage,
an additional 4,248 million kg of carbon dioxide would otherwise have been released into the
atmosphere (Table 76).

b) Soil carbon sequestration
The rate of carbon sequestration in Brazil has been researched by several analysts. Bayer et al
(2006) estimated the mean rate of carbon sequestration in NT Brazilian tropical soils to be 350 kg
carbon ha/year, similar to the 340 kg carbon/ha/year reported for soils from temperate regions,
but lower than the 480 kg/ha/year estimated for southern Brazilian sub-tropical soils. Amado &
Bayer (2008) estimated an average carbon sequestration rate of 170 kg carbon/ha/year (0.0 – 440
kg carbon/ha/year) for NT soils in the south (sub-tropical) and middle-west (tropical) regions of
Brazil. The highest level of carbon sequestration (360 to 420 kg carbon/ha/year) occurs in
intensive cropping systems because of relatively high crop residue levels in the maize/soybean
rotation or where winter and summer cover crops are used.
Applying a conservative soil carbon retention of 200 kg of carbon/ha/year for NT soybean relative
to CT cropping in Brazil (as applied in Argentina), a cumulative total of 11,733 million kg of
carbon (equal to a saving of 43,062 million kg of carbon dioxide) has been retained in the soil that
would otherwise have been released into the atmosphere (Table 77).

4.2.4.4 Bolivia, Paraguay and Uruguay
NT systems have also become important in soybean production in Bolivia, Paraguay and
Uruguay, where the majority of production in these countries use NT systems. Across the three
countries, the area planted to soybeans has increased from 1.8 million ha to 6.05 million ha
between 1999 and 2014 (Paraguay 1.17 to 3.4 million ha, Uruguay 8,900 ha to 1.35 million ha and
Bolivia 0.63 to 1.3 million ha) and the area of GM soybeans from 58,000 ha to 5.7 million ha.
a) Fuel consumption
Using the findings and assumptions applied to Argentina 112 (see above), the savings in fuel
consumption for soybean production between 1999 and 2014 (associated with changes in
no/reduced tillage systems, the adoption of GM HT technology and comparing the proportion of
NT soybeans in 2014 with the 1999 level) has been 511 million litres. At this level of fuel saving,
the reduction in the level of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere has been 1,363 million
kg.
111 F

112

We are not aware of any country-specific studies into NT/RT systems in these three countries. However, analysts consulted in each
country have confirmed that the availability of GM HT technology in soybeans has been an important driver behind the use of NT/RT
production systems. We have applied carbon change assumptions in these countries based on findings from Argentina because this
represents the only available data from a neighbouring country. We acknowledge this represents a weakness to the analysis and the
findings should be treated with caution.

GM crop impact: 1996-2014

b) Soil carbon sequestration
Applying the same rate of soil carbon retention for NT soybeans as Argentina, the cumulative
increase in soil carbon since 1999, due to the increase in NT in Bolivia, Paraguay and Uruguay
soybean production systems, has been 3,764 million kg of carbon. In terms of carbon dioxide
emission this equates to a saving of 13,815 million kg of carbon dioxide that may otherwise have
been released into the atmosphere.
4.2.4.5 Canada
During the period 1996 to 2008 period, tillage practices across the Canadian Prairies changed
considerable with NT increasing from 15% to 51% of the crop prairie area (source: Agriculture
Canada). Since 2009, the NT area accounted for between 52% and 55% of the tillage area, with the
RT and CT shares being 17%-22% and 26%-28% respectively.
The introduction of GM HT soybeans in 1997 facilitated this transition as well as the doubling of
the soybean crop area from 1.06 million ha in 1997 to 2.24 million ha in 2014. Within this, the NT
soybean area increased five-fold from 0.21 million ha in 1997 to 1.23 million ha in 2014 whilst the
RT area increased from 0.33 million ha to 0.38 million ha and the CT area went from 0.52 million
ha to 0.63 million ha.
a) Fuel consumption
Using the fuel saving assumption identified for US soybeans and applying these to Canada, the
savings in fuel consumption for soybean production between 1997 and 2014 has been 141 million
litres. At this level of fuel saving, the reduction in the level of carbon dioxide released into the
atmosphere has been 376 million kg.
b) Soil carbon sequestration
Applying the same carbon sequestration assumptions used for US soybeans, the cumulative
increase in soil carbon since 1997, due to the increase in NT soybean production systems, has
been 534 million kg of carbon. In terms of carbon dioxide emission this equates to a saving of
1,961 million kg of carbon dioxide that may otherwise have been released into the atmosphere.

4.2.5 Herbicide tolerant maize
4.2.5.1 The US
The area of maize cultivated in the US has fluctuated over the last 20 years between 30.64 million
ha (2001) and 37.88 million ha (2007); in 2014 it was 33.64 million ha. Over the 1997-2014
period 113, the maize area using conventional tillage fell by 73%, whilst the NT and RT maize area
increased by 79% and 11% respectively (Table 78).
112F

The most rapid rate of adoption of GM HT maize technology has been by growers using NT
systems (GM HT cultivars accounted for an estimated 99% of total NT maize in 2014). This
compares with conventional tillage systems for maize where GM HT cultivars account for about
75% of total maize plantings (Table 78).

113

GM HT maize was first planted commercially in the US in 1997. However, 1998 was the first year of widespread adoption of the
technology

a) Fuel consumption
Based on the maize crop area planted by tillage system, type of seed planted (biotech and
conventional) and applying the fuel usage consumption rates presented in section 4.2.1 for corn,
the total consumption of tractor fuel between 1997 and 2014 has increased marginally (by just
over 0.21% - 3.1 million litres: Table 79). However, over the same period, the area planted to
maize increased by 4.5%, highlighting a fall in average fuel usage of 4.1% (from 46.6 litres/ha to
44.7 litres/ha). A comparison of GM HT versus conventional production systems shows that in
2014, the average tillage fuel consumption on the GM HT planted area was 43.7 litres/ha
compared to 52.8 litres/ha for the conventional crop.

The cumulative permanent reduction in tillage fuel use in US maize is summarised in Table 80.
This amounted to a reduction in tillage fuel usage of 570 million litres which equates to a
reduction in carbon dioxide emission of 1,522 million kg.

b) Soil carbon sequestration
Based on the crop area planted by tillage system and type of seed planted (GM HT and
conventional) and using estimates of the soil carbon sequestered by tillage system for corn and
soybeans in continuous rotation, the corn NT system is assumed to store 251 kg of
carbon/ha/year, the RT system assumed to store 75 kg carbon/ha/year and the CT system
assumed to store 1 kg carbon/ha/year) 114, our estimates of total soil carbon sequestered are (Table
81):
113 F

•

•

an increase of 796 million kg carbon/year (from 2,577 million kg in 1997 to 3,373 million
kg carbon/year in 2014) due to a combination of an increase in the crop area and the NT
corn area;
the average amount of carbon sequestered per ha increased by 25% from 80.1 in 1997 to
100.2 kg carbon/ha/year in 2014.

Cumulatively, since 1997 the increase in soil carbon due to the increase in RT and NT in US maize
production systems has been 6,050 million kg of carbon which, in terms of carbon dioxide
emissions, equates to a saving of 22,204 million kg of carbon dioxide that would otherwise have
been released into the atmosphere (Table 82). This estimate does not take into consideration the
potential loss in carbon sequestration that might arise from a return to conventional tillage.

114

The actual rate of soil carbon sequestered by tillage system is, however, dependent upon soil type, soil organic content, quantity
and type of crop residue

4.2.5.2 Canada
Against the background of increasing adoption of NT and RT in the Canadian Prairies (see
section 4.2.4.5) and a fluctuating maize area, the introduction and increasing adoption of GM HT
maize technology (from 1999) has facilitated the doubling of the maize NT area from 0.34 million
ha in 1999 to 0.675 million ha in 2014.
a) Fuel consumption
Using the US maize fuel saving assumptions (section 4.2.5.1), the saving in fuel consumption for
Canadian maize production between 1999 and 2014 (associated with changes in RT/NT systems,
the adoption of GM HT technology and comparing the proportion of NT corn in 2014 with the
1999 level) has been 76 million litres. This level of fuel saving is equal to a reduction in the level
of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere of 203 million kg.
b) Soil carbon sequestration
Applying the US carbon sequestrations assumptions for maize to the Canadian crop, the
cumulative increase in soil carbon since 1999 has been 238 million kg of carbon. In terms of
carbon dioxide emission savings, this equates to 873 million kg of carbon dioxide that may
otherwise have been released into the atmosphere.

4.2.5.3 South America
In relation to both Argentina and Brazil it has not been possible to assess if the maize area in
NT/RT has recently or is currently increasing due to the availability of GM HT maize because of a
lack of relevant data and analysis. However, the following should be noted:
•

•

in Argentina, GM HT maize was first available for use in 2004, yet has only become
widely adopted in recent years (60% of 2014 crop used the technology). Therefore, it is
unlikely that the availability of GM HT technology has played a significant role in the
development of NT/RT farming in the Argentine maize crop;
in Brazil, GM HT maize was first adopted on a widespread basis in 2011. Therefore, any
increase in the use of NT/RT in the maize sector up to this date cannot be attributed to
any facilitating role of the technology.

4.2.6 Herbicide tolerant canola
The analysis presented below relates to Canada only and does not include the US GM HT canola
crop as the area devoted to canola in the US is relatively small by comparison to the area in
Canada (0.63 million ha in the US in 2014 compared to 8.34 million ha in Canada).
Smyth et al (2011) surveyed 600 canola farmers in the three prairie provinces of Western Canada
in the years 2007-2009, to evaluate the environmental impacts of the adoption of HT canola. As
well as a reduction in the total number of herbicide applications (resulting in a decrease of
herbicide active ingredient being applied), there were fewer tillage passes, improving moisture
conservation, decreasing soil erosion and a substantial contribution to carbon sequestration in
annual cropland. This research estimated that, by 2009, approximately 1 million tonnes of carbon
(3.67 million tonnes of carbon dioxide) had either been sequestered or no longer released under
land management systems facilitated by HT canola production, as compared to 1995.
Awada L et al (2014) identified that conservation tillage, notably NT, became profitable for, and
popular wit, the majority of Canadian arable farmers during and after the late 1990s and
attributed an important role in the adoption of NT to the availability of GM HT canola. The
increased use of NT contributed to a significant decrease in the area under summer fallow and to
the increase in the area sown to canola and pulse crops. These changes contributed to the
reduction of land degradation and to decreases in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.
a) Fuel consumption
Our estimate for the cumulative, permanent reduction in tillage fuel use in Canadian canola for
the period 1996-2014 is 612 million litres, which equates to a reduction in carbon dioxide
emissions of 1,634 million kg (Table 83).

b) Soil carbon sequestration
The analysis of soil carbon sequestration levels associated with GM HT canola in Canada is based
on the carbon sequestration co-efficient/assumptions derived by McConkey et al (2007). Table 84
summarises this analysis and shows a cumulative increase in soil carbon storage, associated with
the increase in RT and NT in Canadian canola production between 1996 and 2014, of 2,247 million
kg of carbon, which in terms of carbon dioxide emissions, equates to a saving of 8,248 million kg
of carbon dioxide that would otherwise have been released into the atmosphere. Readers should
note these estimates are based on a soil sequestration rate of 55 kg carbon/ha/year (based on
McConkey et al (2007)) which is significantly lower than the rate used in the US for corn (250 kg
carbon/ha/year) due to a combination of lower temperatures and different soil types in the
Canadian canola growing regions compared to the US corn-soybean production belt.

4.2.7 Herbicide tolerant cotton
The contribution to reduced levels of carbon sequestration arising from the adoption of GM HT
cotton is likely to have been marginal and hence no assessments are presented. Although the
area of NT cotton has increased significantly in countries such as the US, it still only represented
23.7% of the total cotton crop in 2009 115. Therefore, no analysis has been undertaken relating to
possible fuel usage and soil carbon sequestration savings associated with the adoption of GM HT
cotton in the US. However, the importance of GM HT cotton in facilitating NT cotton tillage has
been confirmed by Doane Marketing Research (2002) which identified the availability of GM HT
cotton as a key driver for the adoption of NT production practices.
114F

4.2.8 Insect resistant cotton
The cultivation of GM IR cotton has resulted in a significant reduction in the number of
insecticide spray applications. Between 1996 and 2014, the global cotton area planted with GM IR
cultivars increased from 0.77 million ha to 24.33 million ha. Based on a conservative estimate of
four fewer insecticide sprays being required for the cultivation of GM IR cotton relative to
conventional cotton, and applying this to the relevant global area (excluding Burkina Faso, China,
Pakistan, Myanmar, Sudan and India 116) of GM IR cotton over the period 1996-2014, suggests that
there has been a reduction of 216 million ha of cotton ‘spray’ area. The resulting cumulative
saving in tractor fuel consumption has been 181 million litres. This represents a permanent
reduction in carbon dioxide emissions of 484 million kg (Table 85).

4.2.9 Insect resistant maize
Limited analysis of the possible contribution to reduced levels of carbon sequestration from the
adoption of GM IR maize (via fewer insecticide spray runs) is presented. This is because the
impact of IR maize adoption on carbon sequestration is likely to have been small for the
following reasons:
•
•

•

in some countries (eg, Argentina, Philippines) insecticide use for the control of pests
targeted by the technology (eg, corn borer pests) has traditionally been negligible;
even in countries where insecticide use for the control of relevant pests targeted by
the technology has been practised, the share of the total crop treated has been limited
(eg, in the US about 10% and 30% respectively of the crop treated for corn borer and
rootworm pests);
Control practices for CRW in the US often includes the application of insecticides via
seed dressing.

4.2.9.1 Brazil
The impact of using GM IR maize in Brazil (since 2008) has resulted in farmers reducing the
average number of insecticide spray runs by three (from five to two). This equates to a cut of 171
million ha of maize being sprayed in the five years 2008-2014, with a cumulative saving in tractor
fuel of 144 million litres. This is equivalent to a permanent reduction in carbon dioxide emissions
of 384 million kg.
4.2.9.2 US, Canada, South Africa and Spain
Our estimates of the fuel and carbon dioxide savings associated with reduced application of
insecticides with GM IR maize in these countries is based on historic patterns of insecticide
application and therefore limited to:
•

A maximum area equal to the lower of the GM IR area or 10% of the total crop in the US,
Canada and Spain;

GM crop impact: 1996-2014

•

The lower of the GM IR area or 1.7 million ha in South Africa (which in 2014 is equal to
56% of the total maize crop).

Assuming that there has been an average saving of one insecticide spray run on these areas each
year since adoption of the technology, this equates to a reduction in the area sprayed over the
1996 to 2014 period of 76.9 million ‘spray’ ha. The resultant, cumulative saving in tractor fuel
equates to 64.6 million litres, equivalent to a permanent reduction in carbon dioxide emissions of
173 million kg.

4.2.10 Insect resistant soybeans
IR soybean technology was first used commercially in South America in 2013 and in 2014 was
planted on 6.3 million ha in Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay. The adoption of this
technology has enabled farmers to reduce the average number of insecticide spray applications
per ha by four in Brazil, two in Paraguay and one each in Argentina and Uruguay. The
cumulative saving in tractor fuel use over this two-year period has, therefore been equal to 26.7
million litres, equivalent to a permanent reduction in carbon dioxide emissions of 71 million kg.

4.2.11 Intensification of crop production
As well as the adoption of GM technology facilitating the reduction in level of greenhouse gas
emissions via reduced fuel use and additional soil carbon sequestration, the technology also
delivers GHG emission benefits via the improvements in crop production. As indicated in
section 3, the adoption of GM technology has resulted in additional production from a
combination of higher yields and facilitation of second cropping of soybeans after a wheat crop in
South America.
Estimating the possible GHG emissions savings associated with this additional production is,
however, difficult due to the complex array of variables that impact on this and which vary by
location. As such, no estimates are provided in this report. Nevertheless, the following points
are important to recognise in furthering the debate about the potential GHG emission impacts
associated with the use of GM crops and intensification of production:
•

•
•

•

Higher yielding crops assimilate more carbon dioxide into carbohydrate, oxygen and
water than lower yielding crops. Based on Lohry (1998) and applying to the 2013 level of
additional global corn production (50.8 million tonnes) due to GM cultivars, this
additional production assimilated about 171 million tonnes of carbon dioxide (which was
converted by photosynthesis, sunlight, nutrients and water into oxygen and grain);
Increasing crop yields result in an increase in carbon inputs from crop residues into soils
which have a positive effect on soil carbon stocks (Berntsen et al (2006));
Improved yields and additional production from second cropping (of soybeans in South
America) effectively ‘replaces’ the need to extend crop production into new lands (which
will require the switching of land uses from other crops, grazing land and/or nonagricultural land converted into cropping of soybeans, corn, cotton and canola). Where
this land that would otherwise have been brought into agriculture remains in alternative
uses that sequester important levels of GHGs (eg, forestry), it is likely that the net effect
on GHG emissions is positive;
Intensification of production is crucial if new land is not to be brought into production.
For example, analysis by Tilman et al (2011) into meeting projected global food demand

GM crop impact: 1996-2014

•

by 2050 suggests that moderate intensification delivers significant (three-fold)
greenhouse gas emission savings compared to a scenario of no additional intensification.
A question often posed about GHG emissions and more intensive agriculture is the scope
for additional usage of nitrogen resulting in higher levels of nitric oxide emissions more
than offsetting any carbon gains. Researchers such as Burney et al (2010 117) have,
however, concluded that intensification of agriculture leads to a net reduction in GHG
emissions even though fertiliser production and application tends to increase. A metaanalysis of 19 independent studies by Van Groenigen et al (2011) also concluded that the
aims of optimal agricultural production and low GHG emissions are consistent and
deliverable. In particular, emissions of nitrous oxide should be assessed as a function of
crop nitrogen uptake and crop yield with nitrous oxide emissions tending to be stable in
respect of yield levels provided nitrogen is applied efficiently and without waste. In
addition, Katterera et al (2012) estimated that soil carbon stocks can increase by between
1kg-2kg of carbon for each kg of nitrogen fertiliser applied, with extensive production
systems tending to result in lower soil carbon stocks than more intensively managed
land.
116F

Overall, the GHG emission savings arising from both the direct impact and facilitating role of GM
technology (plus the productivity enhancing impact of the technology) ‘fits’ well with the global
need to sustainably intensify production systems.

4.2.12 Summary of carbon sequestration impact
A summary of the carbon sequestration impact is presented in Table 86. This shows the
following key points:
•
•

The permanent savings in carbon dioxide emissions (arising from reduced fuel use of
8,124 million litres of fuel) since 1996 have been about 21,689 million kg;
The additional amount of soil carbon sequestered since 1996 has been equivalent to
186,645 million kg of carbon dioxide that has not been released into the global
atmosphere 118. The reader should note that these soil carbon savings are based on
savings arising from the rapid adoption of NT/RT farming systems in North and South
America (Argentina and Southern Brazil), for which the availability of GM HT
technology has been cited by many farmers as an important facilitator. GM HT
technology has therefore probably been an important contributor to this increase in soil
carbon sequestration, but is not the only factor of influence. Other influences such as the
availability of relatively cheap generic glyphosate (the real price of glyphosate fell
threefold between 1995 and 2000 once patent protection for the product expired) have
also been important. Cumulatively, the amount of carbon sequestered may be higher
than these estimates due to year-on-year benefits to soil quality; however, it is equally
likely that the total cumulative soil sequestration gains have been lower because only a
proportion of the crop area will have remained in NT/RT. For example, NT/RT data from
117 F

Albeit examining the impact on GHG emissions from general intensification of agriculture between 1961 and 2005
These estimates are based on fairly conservative assumptions and therefore the true values could be higher. Also, some of the
additional soil carbon sequestration gains from RT/NT systems may be lost if subsequent ploughing of the land occurs. Estimating the
possible losses that may arise from subsequent ploughing would be complex and difficult to undertake. This factor should be taken
into account when using the estimates presented in this section of the report
117

the US shows that 86% of the soybean crop (28.7 million ha) is typically using NT/RT,
whilst 64% of the maize crop (21.4 million ha) derives from NT/RT. Given that the
soybean: corn rotation is a common system in the US (though not the only system of
production for either crop), this suggests that an important area in RT/NT one year
(whilst planted to maize) remain in NT the next year for a following soybean crop. The
estimate of 186,945 million kg of carbon dioxide not released into the atmosphere should
be treated with caution. It is a theoretical potential, with the actual level of carbon
dioxide savings occurring across a probable wide variation.

Examining further the context of the carbon sequestration benefits, Table 87 measures the carbon
dioxide equivalent savings associated with planting of biotech crops for the latest year (2014), in
terms of the number of car use equivalents. This shows that in 2014, the permanent carbon
dioxide savings from reduced fuel use (2,396 million kg carbon dioxide) was the equivalent of
removing 1.07 million cars from the road for a year and the additional soil carbon sequestration
gains (19,998 million kg carbon dioxide) were equivalent to removing 8.89 million cars from the
roads. In total, biotech crop-related carbon dioxide emission savings in 2014 were equal to the
removal from the roads of 9.95 million cars, equal to 34% of all registered cars in the UK.

Appendix 1: Base yields used where GM technology
delivers a positive yield gain
In order to avoid over-stating the positive yield effect of GM technology (where studies have
identified such an impact) when applied at a national level, average (national level) yields used
have been adjusted downwards (see example below). Production levels based on these adjusted
levels were then cross checked with total production values based on reported average yields
across the total crop.

Marra et al (2002)
examined the findings of
over 40 state-specific

the approximate average
yield impact was +11%.
The lower of these two
values was used for the

from 2003 reflect values
used by Sankala &

Johnson & Strom (2008)
that take into account the
increasing use of
Bollgard II technology,
and draws on work by
Mullins & Hudson (2004)
that identified a yield
gain of +12% relative to
conventional cotton. The
values applied 2005
onwards were adjusted
downwards to reflect the
fact that some of the GM

been planted to Bollgard

Readers should note that the assumptions are drawn from the references cited supplemented and
updated by industry sources (where the authors have not been able to identify specific studies).
This has been particularly of relevance for some of the herbicide tolerant traits more recently
adopted in several developing countries. Accordingly, the authors are grateful to industry
sources which have provided information on impact, (notably on cost of the technology and
impact on costs of crop protection). Whilst this information does not derive from detailed
studies, the authors are confident that it is reasonably representative of average impacts; in a
number of cases, information provided from industry sources via personal communications has
suggested levels of average impact that are lower than that identified in independent studies.
Where this has occurred, the more conservative (industry source) data has been used.
Second soybean crop benefits: Argentina
An additional farm income benefit that many Argentine soybean growers have derived comes
from the additional scope for second cropping of soybeans. This has arisen because of the
simplicity, ease and weed management flexibility provided by the (GM) technology which has
been an important factor facilitating the use of no and reduced tillage production systems. In
turn the adoption of low/no tillage production systems has reduced the time required for
harvesting and drilling subsequent crops and hence has enabled many Argentine farmers to
cultivate two crops (wheat followed by soybeans) in one season. As such, the proportion of
soybean production in Argentina using no or low tillage methods has increased from 34% in 1996
to 90% by 2005 and has remained at over 90% since then.

1. Crop areas and gross margin data based on data supplied by Grupo CEO and the Argentine
Ministry of Agriculture. No data available before 2000, hence 2001 data applied to earlier years but
adjusted, based on GDP deflator rates
2. The second cropping benefits are based on the gross margin derived from second crop soybeans
multiplied by the total area of second crop soybeans (less an assumed area of second crop soybeans
that equals the second crop area in 1996 – this was discontinued from 2004 because of the
importance farmers attach to the GM HT system in facilitating them remaining in no tillage
production systems)

Appendix 4: The Environmental Impact Quotient (EIQ): a
method to measure the environmental impact of
pesticides
The material presented below is from the original by the cited authors of J. Kovach, C. Petzoldt, J.
Degni, and J. Tette, IPM Program, Cornell University,
Methods
Extensive data are available on the environmental effects of specific pesticides, and the data used
were gathered from a variety of sources. The Extension Toxicology Network (EXTOXNET), a
collaborative education project of the environmental toxicology and pesticide education
departments of Cornell University, Michigan State University, Oregon State University, and the
University of California, was the primary source used in developing the database (Hotchkiss et
al. 1989). EXTOXNET conveys pesticide-related information on the health and environmental
effects of approximately 100 pesticides. A second source of information used was CHEM-NEWS
of CENET, the Cornell Cooperative Extension Network. CHEM-NEWS is a computer program
maintained by the Pesticide Management and Education Program of Cornell University that
contains approximately 310 US EPA - Pesticide Fact Sheets, describing health, ecological, and
environmental effects of the pesticides that are required for the re-registration of these pesticides
(Smith and Barnard 1992).
The impact of pesticides on arthropod natural enemies was determined by using the SELCTV
database developed at Oregon State (Theiling and Croft 1988). These authors searched the
literature and rated the effect of about 400 agrichemical pesticides on over 600 species of
arthropod natural enemies, translating all pesticide/natural enemy response data to a scale
ranging from one (0% effect) to five (90-100% effect).
Leaching, surface loss potentials (runoff), and soil half-life data of approximately 100 compounds
are contained in the National Pesticide/Soils Database developed by the USDA Agricultural
Research Service and Soil Conservation Service. This database was developed from the GLEAMS
computer model that simulates leaching and surface loss potential for a large number of
pesticides in various soils and uses statistical methods to evaluate the interactions between
pesticide properties (solubility, absorption coefficient, and half-life) and soil properties (surface
horizon thickness, organic matter content, etc.). The variables that provided the best estimate of
surface loss and leaching were then selected by this model and used to classify all pesticides into
risk groups (large, medium, and small) according to their potential for leaching or surface loss.
Bee toxicity was determined using tables by Morse (1989) in the 1989 New York State pesticide
recommendations, which contain information on the relative toxicity of pesticides to honey bees
from laboratory and field tests conducted at the University of California, Riverside from 1950 to
1980. More than 260 pesticides are listed in this reference.
In order to fill as many data gaps as possible, Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) and technical
bulletins developed by the agricultural chemical industry were also used when available.

Health and environmental factors that addressed some of the common concerns expressed by
farm workers, consumers, pest management practitioners, and other environmentalists were
evaluated and are listed in Figure 1. To simplify the interpretation of the data, the toxicity of the
active ingredient of each pesticide and the effect on each environmental factor evaluated were
grouped into low, medium, or high toxicity categories and rated on a scale from one to five, with
one having a minimal impact on the environment or of a low toxicity and five considered to be
highly toxic or having a major negative effect on the environment.
All pesticides were evaluated using the same criteria except for the mode of action and plant
surface persistence of herbicides. As herbicides are generally systemic in nature and are not
normally applied to food crops we decided to consider this class of compounds differently, so all
herbicides were given a value of one for systemic activity. This has no effect on the relative
rankings within herbicides, but it does make the consumer component of the equation for
herbicides more realistic. Also, since plant surface persistence is only important for postemergent herbicides and not pre-emergent herbicides, all post-emergent herbicides were
assigned a value of three and pre-emergent herbicides assigned a value of one for this factor.
The rating system used to develop the environmental impact quotient of pesticides (EIQ) model
is as follows (l = least toxic or least harmful, 5 = most toxic or harmful):
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Mode of Action: non-systemic- 1, all herbicides – 1, systemic – 3
Acute Dermal LD50 for Rabbits/Rats(m&/kg): >2000 – 1, 200 - 2000 – 3, 0 - 200 – 5
Long-Term Health Effects: little or none – 1, possible- 3, definite – 5
Plant Surface Residue Half-life: l-2 weeks- 1, 2-4 weeks- 3, > 4 weeks – 5, pre-emergent
herbicides – l, post-emergent herbicides – 3
Soil Residue Half-life: Tl/2 <30 days – 1, Tl/2=30-100 days – 3, Tl/2 >100 days – 5
Toxicity to Fish-96 hr LC50: > 10 ppm – 1, 1-10 ppm – 3, < 1 ppm – 5
Toxicity to Birds-8 day LC50: > 1000 ppm – 1, 100-1000 ppm – 3, 1-100 ppm – 5
Toxicity to Bees: relatively non toxic – 1, moderately toxic – 3, highly toxic – 5
Toxicity to Beneficials: low impact- 1, moderate impact – 3, severe impact – 5
Groundwater and Runoff Potential: small – 1, medium – 3, large -5

In order to further organise and simplify the data, a model was developed called the
environmental impact quotient of pesticides (EIQ). This model reduces the environmental
impact information to a single value. To accomplish this, an equation was developed based on
the three principal components of agricultural production systems: a farm worker component, a
consumer component, and an ecological component. Each component in the equation is given
equal weight in the final analysis, but within each component, individual factors are weighted
differently. Coefficients used in the equation to give additional weight to individual factors are
also based on a one to five scale. Factors carrying the most weight are multiplied by five,
medium-impact factors are multiplied by three, and those factors considered to have the least
impact are multiplied by one. A consistent rule throughout the model is that the impact potential
of a specific pesticide on an individual environmental factor is equal to the toxicity of the
chemical times the potential for exposure. Stated simply, environmental impact is equal to
toxicity times exposure. For example, fish toxicity is calculated by determining the inherent
toxicity of the compound to fish times the likelihood of the fish encountering the pesticide. In this
manner, compounds that are toxic to fish but short-lived have lower impact values than
compounds that are toxic and long-lived.

The EIQ Equation
The formula for determining the EIQ value of individual pesticides is listed below and is the
average of the farm worker, consumer, and ecological components:
EIQ={C[(DT*5)+(DT*P)]+[(C*((S+P)/2)*SY)+(L)]+[(F*R)+(D*((S+P)/2)*3)+(Z*P*3)+(B*P*5)]}/3
DT = dermal toxicity, C = chronic toxicity, SY = systemicity, F = fish toxicity, L = leaching
potential, R = surface loss potential, D = bird toxicity, S = soil half-life, Z = bee toxicity, B =
beneficial arthropod toxicity, P = plant surface half-life.
Farm worker risk is defined as the sum of applicator exposure (DT* 5) plus picker exposure
(DT*P) times the long-term health effect or chronic toxicity (C). Chronic toxicity of a specific
pesticide is calculated as the average of the ratings from various long-term laboratory tests
conducted on small mammals. These tests are designed to determine potential reproductive
effects (ability to produce offspring), teratogenic effects (deformities in unborn offspring),
mutagenic effects (permanent changes in hereditary material such as genes and chromosomes),
and oncogenic effects (tumour growth). Within the farm worker component, applicator exposure
is determined by multiplying the dermal toxicity (DT) rating to small laboratory mammals
(rabbits or rats) times a coefficient of five to account for the increased risk associated with
handling concentrated pesticides. Picker exposure is equal to dermal toxicity (DT) times the
rating for plant surface residue half-life potential (the time required for one-half of the chemical
to break down). This residue factor takes into account the weathering of pesticides that occurs in
agricultural systems and the days to harvest restrictions that may be placed on certain pesticides.
The consumer component is the sum of consumer exposure potential (C*((S+P)/2)*SY) plus the
potential groundwater effects (L). Groundwater effects are placed in the consumer component
because they are more of a human health issue (drinking well contamination) than a wildlife
issue. Consumer exposure is calculated as chronic toxicity (C) times the average for residue
potential in soil and plant surfaces (because roots and other plant parts are eaten) times the
systemic potential rating of the pesticide (the pesticide's ability to be absorbed by plants).
The ecological component of the model is composed of aquatic and terrestrial effects and is the
sum of the effects of the chemicals on fish (F*R), birds (D*((S+P)/2)*3), bees (Z*P*3), and beneficial
arthropods(B*P*5). The environmental impact of pesticides on aquatic systems is determined by
multiplying the chemical toxicity to fish rating times the surface runoff potential of the specific
pesticide (the runoff potential takes into account the half-life of the chemical in surface water).
The impact of pesticides on terrestrial systems is determined by summing the toxicities of the
chemicals to birds, bees, and beneficial arthropods. As terrestrial organisms are more likely to
occur in commercial agricultural settings than fish, more weight is given to the pesticidal effects
on these terrestrial organisms. Impact on birds is measured by multiplying the rating of toxicity
to birds by the average half-life on plant and soil surfaces times three. Impact on bees is
measured by taking the pesticide toxicity ratings to bees times the half-life on plant surfaces times
three. The effect on beneficial arthropods is determined by taking the pesticide toxicity rating to
beneficial natural enemies, times the half-life on plant surfaces times five. As arthropod natural
enemies spend almost all of their life in agro ecosystem communities (while birds and bees are
somewhat transient), their exposure to the pesticides, in theory, is greater. To adjust for this
increased exposure, the pesticide impact on beneficial arthropods is multiplied by five.
Mammalian wildlife toxicity is not included in the terrestrial component of the equation because
mammalian exposure (farm worker and consumer) is already included in the equation, and these

health effects are the results of tests conducted on small mammals such as rats, mice, rabbits, and
dogs.
After the data on individual factors were collected, pesticides were grouped by classes
(fungicides, insecticides/miticides, and herbicides), and calculations were conducted for each
pesticide. When toxicological data were missing, the average for each environmental factor
within a class was determined, and this average value was substituted for the missing values.
Thus, missing data did not affect the relative ranking of a pesticide within a class.
The values of individual effects of each pesticide (applicator, picker, consumer, groundwater,
aquatic, bird, bee, beneficials), the major components of the equation (farm worker, consumer,
and ecological) and the average EIQ values are presented in separate tables (see references).
EIQ field use rating
Once an EIQ value has been established for the active ingredient of each pesticide, field use
calculations can begin. To accurately compare pesticides and pest management strategies, the
dose, the formulation or percent active ingredient of the product, and the frequency of
application of each pesticide, need to be determined. To account for different formulations of the
same active ingredient and different use patterns, a simple equation called the EIQ field use
rating was developed. This rating is calculated by multiplying the EIQ value for the specific
chemical obtained in the tables by the percent active ingredient in the formulation by the rate per
acre used (usually in pints or pounds of formulated product);
EIQ Field Use Rating = EIQ x % active ingredient x Rate
By applying the EIQ Field Use Rating, comparisons can be made between different pest
management strategies or programs. To compare different pest management programs, EIQ Field
Use Ratings and number of applications throughout the season are determined for each pesticide
and these values are then summed to determine the total seasonal environmental impact of the
particular strategy.

Appendix 5 Soil carbon sequestration key literature
Soil organic carbon can be depleted through:
•
•

the long-term use of farming practices; and
the conversion of natural ecosystems (such as forest lands, prairie lands and steppes) into
crop and grazing land.

These uses deplete the soil organic carbon pool by increasing the rate of conversion of soil
organic matter to carbon dioxide, thereby reducing the input of biomass carbon and accentuating
losses by erosion. Most agricultural soils have lost 30 tonnes/ha to 40 tonnes/ha of carbon, and
their current reserves of soil organic carbon are lower than their potential capacity.
The significant degradation of crop soils by the oxidation of soil carbon into carbon dioxide
started in the 1850’s with the introduction of large scale soil cultivation using the mouldboard
plough. The effect of ploughing on soil carbon has been measured by Reicosky (1995) for a
selection of cultivation techniques (after tilling wheat). Using a mouldboard plough results in
soil carbon losses far exceeding the carbon value of the previous wheat crop residue and
depleting soil carbon by 1,990 kg/ha compared with a no-tillage system. Furthermore, Lal et al
(1999) estimated that the global release of soil carbon since 1850 from land use changes has been
136 +/- 55 Pg 119 (billion tonnes) of carbon. This is approximately half of the total carbon emissions
from fossil fuels (270 +/- 30 Pg (billion tonnes)), with soil cultivation accounting for 78 +/- 12 Pg
and soil erosion 26 +/- 9 Pg of carbon emissions. Lal also estimated that the potential of carbon
sequestration in soil, biota and terrestrial ecosystems may be as much as 3 Pg C per year (1.41
parts per million of atmospheric carbon dioxide). A strategy of soil carbon sequestration over a
25-50 year period could therefore have a substantial impact on lowering the rate at which carbon
dioxide is rising in the atmosphere providing the necessary time to adopt alternative energy
strategies.
118F

Reversing this trend can be achieved by a variety of soil and crop management technologies that
increase soil carbon sequestration. These include:
•
•
•
•
•

no-till farming with residue mulch and cover cropping;
integrated nutrient management (INM), which balances nutrient application with use of
organic manures and inorganic fertilizers;
various crop rotations (including agroforestry);
use of soil amendments (such as zeolites, biochar, or compost); and
improved pastures with recommended stocking rates and controlled fire as a rejuvenate
method (Lal (2009)).

The production benefits of increasing soil carbon storage include increased soil infiltration,
fertility and nutrient cycling, decreased wind and water erosion, minimal soil compaction,
enhanced water quality, decreased carbon emissions, impeding pesticide movement and
generally enhanced environmental quality. The soil management practices that sequester soil

carbon are consistent with a more sustainable and less chemically dependent agriculture
(Reicosky (2004)).
Quantification of the impacts of tillage on carbon stocks is complex due to the combination and
complexities of soil, climate and management conditions, especially crop type and rotation.
Issues affecting the levels of carbon sequestration include:
•
•
•
•
•
•

Soil and climatic factors;
Shallow sampling may introduce a bias in estimating carbon sequestration in NT;
Initial soil carbon levels;
Crop biomass production (soil carbon inputs);
Organic carbon mineralization (soil carbon outputs);
Soil erosion and re-deposition on soil organic gains and losses.

A number of researchers have examined issues relating to carbon sequestration and different
tillage systems and the following are of note:
•

West and Post (2002). This work analysed 67 long-term agricultural experiments,
consisting of 276 paired treatments. These results indicate, on average, that a change
from conventional tillage (CT) to no-till (NT) can sequester 57 +/- 14 g carbon per square
metre per year (grams carbon m-2 year-1), excluding a change to NT in wheat-fallow
systems. The cropping system that obtained the highest level of carbon sequestration
when tillage changed from CT to NT was corn: soybeans in rotation (90 +/- 59 grams
carbon m-2 year-1).) This level of carbon sequestration equates to 900 +/- 590
kg/carbon/ha/yr, which would have decreased carbon dioxide level in the atmosphere by
3,303 +/- 2,165 kg of carbon dioxide per ha/year 120;
Johnson et al (2005) summarised how alternative tillage and cropping systems interact to
sequester soil organic carbon (SOC) and impact on GHG emissions from the main
agricultural area in central USA. This analysis estimated that the rate of SOC storage in
NT compared to CT has been significant, but variable, averaging 400 +/- 61
kg/carbon/ha/yr);
Calegari et al (2008) conducted a 19 year experiment comparing CT and NT management
systems with various winter cover crop treatments in Brazil. The research identified that
the NT system led to 64.6% more carbon being retained in the upper soil layer than in the
CT system. It also found that using NT with winter cover crops resulted in soil
properties that most closely resembled an undisturbed forest (ie, best suited for
greenhouse gas storage). In addition, both maize and soybean yields were found to be
respectively 6% and 5% higher, under NT, than CT production systems;
Eagle et al (2012) examined the literature on GHG mitigation potential of conservation
tillage and NT. Based on 280 field comparisons of soil carbon response to no-till the
average mitigation potential was estimated at 1,200 kg of carbon dioxide per hectare per
year with a range of -200 to 3,200.
Olson et al (2013) evaluated soil carbon levels over a 24-year period on eroded soils in
Southern Illinois that were under a corn and soybeans rotation that used different tillage

systems. The NT system stored and retained 7.8 tonnes of carbon per ha more than CT
plots.
Kahlona et al (2013) evaluated different tillage practices and the importance of mulching
on soil physical properties and carbon sequestration over a period of 22 years. The NT
plots consistently resulted in positive effects on soil physical attributes and total carbon
concentration;
Bernoux et al (2006) reviewed cropping systems, carbon sequestration and erosion in
Brazil. Over 30 years of no-tillage practice carbon levels in topsoil increased. This paper
reviewed several studies and identified the rate of carbon storage in the top 40 cm of the
soil ranges from 400 to 1,700 kg carbon/ha/year in the Cerrado region. The mean rates of
carbon storage in the soil surface area (0-20 cm) varied from 600 to 680 kg carbon/ha/year
with the greatest variation in the southern region of -70 to 1,600 kg carbon/ha/year
(standard deviation 680 +/- 540 kg carbon/ha/year). In addition, in Brazilian conditions
direct seeding offers the scope for earlier sowing of crops, shortening the total production
cycle, facilitating a second crop in the same season. This results in more carbon being
returned to the soil;
IPCC estimates put the rate of soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration by the conversion
from conventional to all conservation tillage (NT and RT) in North America within a
range of 50 to 1,300 kg carbon/ha/year (it varies by soil type, cropping system and ecoregion), with a mean of 300 kg carbon/ha/year;
The adoption of NT systems has also had an impact on other GHG emissions such as
methane and nitrous oxide which are respectively 23 and 296 times more potent than
carbon dioxide. Robertson (2002) and Sexstone et al (1985) suggested that the adoption of
NT (sequestering SOC) could do so at the expense of increased nitrous oxide production
if growers were to increase the use of nitrogen fertiliser in NT production systems;
Robertson et al (2000) measured gas fluxes for carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide and methane
and other sources of global warming potential (GWP) in cropped and unmanaged
ecosystems over the period 1991 to 1999. They found that the net GWP was highest for
conventional tillage systems at 114 grams of carbon dioxide equivalents/ha/year
compared with 41 grams/ha/year for an organic system with legumes cover and 14
grams/ha/year for a no-till system (with liming) and minus 20 grams/ha/year for a NT
system (without liming). The major factors influencing the beneficial effect of no-till over
conventional and organic systems is the high level of carbon sequestration and reduced
use of fuel resulting in emissions of 12 grams of carbon dioxide equivalents m-2 year-1
compared with 16 grams in conventional tillage and 19 grams for organic tillage. The
release of nitrous oxide in terms of carbon dioxide was equivalent in the organic and NT
systems due to the availability of nitrogen under the organic system compared with the
targeted use of nitrogen fertiliser under the NT systems;
The importance of nitrogen fixing legume grain crops has also been investigated by
Almaraz et al (2009). They studied the GHG emission associated with N2 fixing soybean
grown under CT and NT tillage systems. Their findings suggest that using NT in Nfixing legume crops may reduce both carbon dioxide and N2O emissions in comparison
to CT, because in the CT system, harvest residue is incorporated into the soil during
ploughing (increasing N2O emissions);
Omonode et al (2011) assessed N2O emissions in corn following three decades of different
tillage and rotation systems. Seasonal cumulative N2O emissions were significantly
lower by 40%-57% under NT compared to long term chisel and mouldboard plough

tillage systems, due to soil organic C decomposition associated with higher levels of soil
residue mixing and higher soil temperatures;
Using IPCC emission factors, Johnson et al (2005) estimated the offsetting effect of
alternative fertiliser management and cropping systems. For a NT cropping system that
received 100 kg N per ha per year (net from all sources), the estimated annual nitrous
oxide emission of 2.25 kg N per ha per year would have to increase by 32%-97% to
completely offset carbon sequestration gains of 100-300 kg per ha per year;
Baker et al (2007) expressed caution with the premise that NT results in positive carbon
sequestration compared with CT. Their analysis identified 37 out of 45 studies (from 17
experiments) with sampling depth <30 cm at which NT treatments (82%) reported more
SOC than in the CT control with a mean annual SOC gain of 380 +/- 720 kg/ha/yr. In
contrast, in 35 of 51 studies (from 5 experiments) with sampling depths >30 cm, the NT
treatments registered less SOC relative to CT with a mean annual loss of -230 +/- 970
kg/ha/yr. In both cases, however, the standard error associated with the estimates was so
large that the mean (impact of tillage) was not considered to be significant;
Research by Angers and Eriksen-Hamel (2008) and Blanco-Canqui and Lal (2008) found
that the majority of SOC increase under NT is in the top 10 to 15 cm of soil with
insignificant changes (or even decreases) in SOC relative to CT at depths over 15 cm.
Hence, newly sequestered carbon in a NT system is accumulated where it is most
vulnerable to environmental and management pressures. This makes any permanent
increase in SOC associated with NT systems vulnerable to changes in environmental
pressures and soil management practices;
Angers and Eriksen-Hamel’s (2008) work also compared NT and full-inversion tillage
(FIT) trials and found that while there was a statistically significant increase in total SOC
stocks under NT (100.3 versus 95.4 Mg C ha-1 for NT and FIT respectively in the upper 10
cm), to the 21-25 cm soil depth (which corresponds to the mean ploughing depth (23
cm)), the average SOC content was significantly greater under FIT than NT. It was also
greater under FIT just below the average depth of ploughing (26-35 cm). However,
overall there was significantly more SOC (4.9 Mg ha-1) under NT than FIT across all
depths and this difference in favour of NT increased weakly with the duration of the
experiment;
Syswerda et al (2011) examined whether soil sequestration gains in the surface layer may
result in soils losing carbon at depth under NT compared with CT. Results indicated that
surface soil carbon concentrations and total carbon pools were significantly greater under
NT than CT. No difference in soil carbon at depth was identified although carbon levels
were found to be variable. Also there was no evidence of carbon gains in the surface soils
of NT being either offset or magnified at depth;
Al-Kaisi (2005) evaluated the effects of different tillage systems on soil organic carbon
(SOC) and nitrogen (SON), residue carbon and nitrogen inputs and crop (corn and
soybean) yields in Iowa. Yields of both corn and soybean were comparable in NT and
mouldboard tillage systems but in NT and strip-tillage there was a significant increase in
SOC of 14.7% and 11.4% respectively. Changes in SON due to tillage were similar to
those observed with the SOC experiments;
The corn-soybean rotation in the US offers the opportunity for considerable carbon
sequestration under NT systems. Hollinger et al (2005) measured the carbon flux from
1997 to 2002 to evaluate the carbon budget for corn and soybean in rotation that had been
in NT cultivation for over 14 years. The carbon sink when planted with corn was 576 g C
m per year and soybean 33 g C m per year. Accounting for 100% grain consumption,

corn acts as a C-sink of 184 g C m per year while soybean becomes a C-source of 94 g C
m per year. As these crops are generally grown in rotation, this system is a net sink of 90
g C m per year;
Long term research comparing CT with NT has demonstrated that NT results in higher
soil carbon and nitrogen contents, microbial biomass and enzyme activities at the 0-5 cm
depth (Mathew et al. (2012)). NT soils are more biologically active and diverse, have
higher nutrient loading capacities, release nutrients gradually and continuously and have
better soil structure than reduced or cultivated soils (Clapperton, J. (2003)). By enhancing
the organic matter a higher Carbon-Stock Equilibrium (CSE) can be achieved;
Bernacchi et al (2005) estimate that if the total area of corn/soybeans in the US converted
to no-till, 21.7 Tg C (21.7 million tonnes) would be sequestered annually (approximately
350 kg/C/ha/yr), an offset of about 2% of annual USA carbon emissions;
The most effective natural method of achieving soil carbon sequestration is by the
absorption of atmospheric carbon dioxide in plants by photosynthesis, where plants
convert carbon dioxide into plant tissue (lignin and carbohydrates) and oxygen. When a
plant dies, a portion of the stored carbon is left behind in the soil by decomposing plant
residue (eg, roots, stalks) and a larger portion is emitted back into the atmosphere. This
plant residue carbon pool contributes 20% to 23% of the total carbon present in maizebased agricultural ecosystems. Short-term carbon sequestration estimates largely reflect
plant residue carbon pool changes which are driven by crop inputs and net
decomposition differences (Kochsiek et al. (2012)). Decomposition rates tend to be
proportional to the amount of organic matter, the physiochemical and microbial
properties of the soil;
The potential for maximising soil sequestration tends to be higher in
degraded/desertified soils, and soils that have been managed with extractive farming
practices, than it is in good-quality soils that have been managed according to
recommended management practices (RMPs). Thus, converting degraded/desertified
soils into restorative land and adopting RMPs can increase the soil carbon pool. The rate
of soil carbon sequestration through the adoption of RMPs on degraded soils ranges from
100 kg/ha per year in warm and dry regions to 1,500 kg/ha per year in cool and temperate
regions. Lal R (2010) estimated the technical potential of soil organic carbon
sequestration through adoption of RMPs for world cropland soils (1.5 billion ha) to be 0.6
billion to 1.2 billion tonnes of carbon per year and about 3 billion tonnes of carbon per
year in soils of all ecosystems (eg, cropland, grazing land, forest lands, degraded lands
and wetlands.
In some cases, intermittent tillage, during long-term RT or NT is needed to reduce soil
compaction, for weed control, or to reduce pests or pathogens. While intermittent tillage
can cause a decrease in soil stocks, up to 80% of soil gains from NT practices can be
maintained when implementing NT with intermittent tillage (Conant et al (2007);
Venterea et al (2006)).

Some studies have questioned the accuracy and the level of carbon sequestered previously
projected for NT compared with CT (eg Virto et al (2012)). Yang et al (2013) concluded that NT
has been widely adopted because it reduces labour, fuel and machinery costs, conserves water,
and reduces soil erosion which has contributes to improved soil quality and agricultural
sustainability. However, it may not be appropriate to attribute all the higher carbon content in
the surface of NT soil to either increased carbon input or reduced carbon mineralization (output)
relative to CT, when the differences may be due to soil erosion.

GM crop impact: 1996-2014

Lastly, Powlson et al (2014) questioned the assumptions of the UN Emissions Gap Report 2013
which presented a case that additional adoption of NT could further contribute to more carbon
sequestration because much of the most suitable land for adoption of NT is already using this
production system. Powlson did, however, acknowledge that widespread adoption of NT in
North and South America had delivered important carbon sequestration savings and if this land
was to revert to CT, it would result in significant carbon release.
The discussion above illustrates the difficulty in estimating the contribution NT systems can
make to soil carbon sequestration. The modelling of soil carbon sequestration is also made more
difficult by the dynamic nature of soils, climate, cropping types and patterns. If a specific crop
area is in continuous NT crop rotation, the full SOC benefits described above can be realised.
However, if the NT crop area is returned to a conventional tillage system, a proportion of the
SOC gain will be lost. The temporary nature of this form of carbon storage will only become
permanent when farmers adopt a continuous NT system which itself tends to be highly
dependent upon effective herbicide-based weed control systems.

How to show consumers the benefits of genetically modified foods 
June 29, 2018 by David Di Zhang And Grant Alexander Wilson, The Conversation 
Genetically modified (GM) foods for human consumption have long been a subject of intense public debate, as well as academic research. 
In our upcoming article in the Journal of Commercial Biotechnology, we show that consumers' attitudes toward GM foods, their willingness to purchase them and the price they are willing to pay could be significantly improved if GM products had a direct benefit to them personally. 
Our findings at the University of Saskatchewan's Edwards School of Business have the potential to change how agriculture biotechnology companies promote their products —while also creating significant value. 
Particularly, we found that consumers are willing to accept and pay premiums for GM foods that have value that's personally relevant to them. 
In other words, changing the value proposition from industry-centric to consumer-centric may help to mitigate the negatives associated with GM food. 
Food insecurity is critical 
In 2009, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations identified global food security as an increasingly critical issue as the world population grows, and said that meeting the growing demand for food will require agricultural biotechnology. Therefore it's necessary to build widespread consumer support for GM foods. 
Creating GM food with direct consumer benefits could play a pivotal role in gaining such support. Not only does promoting direct consumer benefits have the potential to change perceptions, as shown by our study's data, it may also be a profitable endeavour. 
We surveyed 750 Canadian consumers on different ways of presenting GM foods. 
The first group of consumers saw ads for GM foods that promoted several industry-oriented benefits that might indirectly appeal to consumers, such as higher yield, less pesticide usage and enhanced global food supply. These messages were similar to those typically promoted by GM food proponents. 
The second group of consumers saw ads focusing on direct consumer benefits, such as better taste and enhanced nutrition. 
The third group of consumers saw ads for GM foods that promoted both direct and indirect consumer benefits. 
The result of the survey showed that, not surprisingly, the participants in the first group were less inclined to buy GM foods even at a price that was significantly lower than comparable non-GM foods. 
The consumers who were accepting of GM foods appreciated that GM technology had positive benefits and was creating value. However, they believed that the technology has only benefited the industry, and demanded that a portion of the value is passed onto the consumers. 
In contrast, the participants who were presented a value proposition that directly benefited both the industry and consumers reported better attitudes toward GM foods, expressed higher purchase intentions —and they were willing to pay a premium for such products. 
Why consumers do, or don't, accept GM foods 
These findings suggest that how consumers assess the value of GM foods to themselves personally, as opposed to solely how or why the food is made, is fundamental to consumers' attitudes, purchase intentions and willingness to pay. 
Many previous studies have examined consumer perceptions of GM foods and explored why or why not consumers were reluctant to accept them. 
A 2016 study conducted meta-analyses that reviewed hundreds of prior studies and how consumers' personal characteristics could influence their acceptance of GM food. Those factors included gender (men might be more likely to accept genetically modified foods than women), education, income (consumers with higher income might be less likely to accept GM foods), prior knowledge and family situations, etc. 
In other words, the emphasis has been on figuring out how to change consumers so that they would accept GM foods. 
But our research points to the need for the GM industry to change how it's promoting the products, and to begin producing foods that directly benefit consumers. The agricultural biotechnology industry needs to place consumer interests at the centre of their focus, not only at the time of selling their products, but also during the research and development processes. 
Indeed, in a previous University of Saskatchewan study, we found that in Canada, consumer-oriented biotechnology companies generally outperform those that aren't consumer-oriented. 
Healthier rice 
The idea of a second generation of GM products —the kind that could hold real appeal to consumers —is now gaining momentum. 
Nonetheless, promoting direct consumer benefits is not a total panacea. 
Even while successfully showing consumers how GM foods can benefit them personally, there were still a substantial portion of the participants in our study (35 per cent to 50 per cent, depending on the products presented) who refuse to purchase GM foods no matter the price. 
This indicates that consumer acceptance of GM foods is a complicated matter. There's still a long road ahead to convince shoppers at the grocery stores to consider genetically modified foods as personally beneficial. 
As the U.S. Department of Agriculture prepares guidelines for labeling products that contain genetically modified ingredients, a new study from the University of Vermont reveals that a simple disclosure can improve consumer ... 
New research from North Carolina State University and the University of Minnesota shows that the majority of consumers will accept the presence of nanotechnology or genetic modification (GM) technology in foods - but only ... 
A new Drexel University study found strong potential for consumer acceptance of a new category of foods created from discarded ingredients. 
There's a lot of interest in how the public will respond to incorporating new technologies, such as nanotechnology or genetic modification (GM), into food products – but it can be difficult to tell which technologies will ... 
While consumers are aware of genetically modified crops and food, their knowledge level is limited and often at odds with the facts, according to a newly published study by a University of Florida researcher. 
Consumers are eager to get their hands on, and teeth into, foods that are genetically modified to increase health benefits  and even pay more for the opportunity.

Dr Graham PhillipsSt Louis is famous for its giant arch. It symbolises the fact that this place was a gateway to the west of America from the east of America back in the 1800s. But in scientific circles these days St Louis is famous for being one of the world centres for genetically modified food. 
NARRATIONThis is the home of Monsanto - the biggest GM - and conventional - seed supplier in the world. 
NARRATIONThey've genetically engineered grains like canola and soy to be tolerant to their proprietary herbicide Roundup. 
Bob PhelpsThe sale of the seed and chemical package to farmers with the attendant cost is really the way that Monsanto has run its business. 
NARRATIONThere has been plenty of outcry over Roundup-ready crops. 
NARRATIONBut now there's a new direction in GM - enhancing nutrition. Monsanto's genetically engineered soybeans to make a healthier oil. 
Dr Graham PhillipsThis is the standard vegetable oil you buy at the supermarket. Would you be willing to, rather than put this on your salad, go with this product? This is a soy oil. Now the standard oil has about 10% of those heart-healthy omega three fatty acids in it. This one has 25 per cent. And the omega three in here is in a much healthier form. 
Dr David StarkThe healthier Omega-3s that we get come from fish and they actually get it from algae because they eat the algae. Vegetables like soybeans and canola also make Omega-3s but they don't have the same health benefit as what we get from fish. 
NARRATIONFish oil is particularly good for heart health. 
Dr David StarkIt helps prevent the arrhythmia in the ventricle part of the heart and that's what kills you from a heart attack it's not the clogged artery it's the arrhythmia. 
NARRATIONThe genes to make Omega-3 were from surprising sources. 
Dr David StarkThe genes actually come from a mushroom and a petunia so we tried algae because everything we do in GM we learn how nature does it and then we take it into the plant that we want to grow and consume. The algae genes didn't work as well in soybean but we found that the mushroom and petunia versions did so that's where we went for our gene sources. 
NARRATIONBut of course the people who could really benefit from more nutritious food live in the third world. 
NARRATIONOne of the staple crops in Africa is cassava. 
Dr Martin FregeneIt came to Africa with the Portuguese traders 500 years ago and it displaced every other staple crop, it displaced yams, it displaced yam, it displaced everything and today if you look at Cassava's production figures in Africa is going like that (points upwards) almost vertical. 
NARRATIONCassava's one of the few crops that grows well in drought conditions, and in poor soil - and it can handle Africa's fluctuating markets. 
Dr Martin FregeneYou can keep cassava in the ground for two years and not harvest it and go back and harvest it when the market is right so this is one crop that's it's almost a miracle crop. 
NARRATIONBut it's no miracle when it comes to nutrition. 
Dr Nigel TaylorThis is an excellent source of calories full of starch, but the roots here are devoid of protein, almost no protein whatsoever in here, there's no vitamin A, very little vitamin E, no iron or zinc, so it means that if you rely on this crop as your staple foods you'll suffer from malnutrition. 
NARRATIONSo, at Saint Louis's Danforth Center, researchers are genetically modifying cassava. They're inserting genes to increase protein, vitamin A and iron. 
Dr Nigel TaylorSo that if you eat cassava for your breakfast then you'll be receiving all of these nutrients that you require for the whole day in one meal. 
NARRATIONAfter the new genes are inserted, the plants are grown in some very sophisticated greenhouses. 
Dr Graham PhillipsThey have incredible control over the conditions in these greenhouses. In fact they can recreate virtually any environment on Earth. You can have a nice balmy 30 degrees Celsius and very high, almost 100 per cent humidity. Or you can turn it right down and have it just four degrees Celsius and very low humidity. 
NARRATIONFor GM cassava, the conditions in sub-Saharan Africa are dialled in. 
NARRATIONSuccess here could have an enormous impact on the Third World. 
Dr Paul AndersonThis really isn't all about just making a couple of new lines this is about improving the nutritional value of a crop for ever worldwide so that its always going to have a better nutrient content and a person eating that is always going to have the benefits of that regardless of where they are or when they're eating it. 
Dr Martin FregeneIn Nigeria for example you save 39 thousand children from dying you know every year from provitamin A deficiency. 
NARRATIONBut there's no need to head down the GM route even in Africa according to critics. 
Bob PhelpsWell the Food and Agriculture Organisation reports that there's enough food currently produced in the world to feed 12 billion people, and we have a population of six billion so we could feed everyone well twice. 
NARRATIONSuch debate doesn't impress Martin. 
Dr Martin FregeneIf you've never been hungry then you can get involved in all those kind of debates but if you've really been hungry then it's not an argument you know it's so clear it's so obvious. 
NARRATIONThe GM Cassava will leave the lab for test fields in about four years. And if all works out, it'll be available to farmers a couple of years after that.

Such poor in-depth research and searching interviews has me relegating Catalyst to an advertorial daytime commercial television slot. 
How could you be so nieve as to give such unbalanced coverage to such intertwined bodies and think the ABC viewer would fall for it? 
OK, it begs the question: where was the connection? Please list all the freebies; kick-backs; offers; and personal / partners / family / friend connections with pro-GM agro-chemical companies / groups. 
Pick up your socks - this was a disgusting effort at a balanced story. There are so many emminently qualified Australians who could have torn this story to shreds. 
Perhaps Media Watch should review.

Phillips: "This one has 25 per cent. And the omega three in here is in a much healthier form." 
AND... you ALSO get a 450% increase in trans fatty acids: 
Via the FSANZ nutritional assessment doc - 
"As mentioned in Section 1.2, there is a consequential increase in trans-SDA (from zero to0.26% of total fatty acids) and trans-ALA (from 0.14% to 0.51% of total fatty acids) as aresult of increasing the SDA and, to a lesser extent, the ALA content of SDA soybean oil.Trans fatty acids (TFAs) in the diet raise LDL-cholesterol and lower HDL-cholesterol, thuscontribute to an increased risk of coronary heart disease."

Here's a bit of background that could be helpful for our publicly funded Catalyst scientists.. (in slightly extended tweets) 
Reading through the B&M Gates Foundation grants for Agricultural Development http://bit.ly/61fv9j 
... time passes ... 
[Introducing] Nagib Nassar, Geneticist, Botanist and Plant Breeder <- Years of research in cassava http://bit.ly/fJjIFr [Brazilian, 50 years of research, Emeritus Professor] 
2009: Nassar reports finding a cassava so rich in beta-carotene (Vit A precurser) that 100g gives 4-fold greater than human daily needs.. http://bit.ly/gYs9Cq [from diverse Amazon stock] 
Nassar reports this very high Vit A cassava has excellent palatability. It could be planted directly or bred. http://bit.ly/gYs9Cq 
In May 2010 Scientific American publishes an article about Nassar and high nutrient & yield cassavas http://bit.ly/eJvnzF via @GMWatch 
Nov10 Gates Foundn grants (Monsanto-founded) Danforth centre $5.3M to develop high iron, protein, Vit A cassava for Africa http://bit.ly/61fv9j 
In Jan11 Danforth (Mon-founded) reports proof of concept towards development of GM cassava for supplying "products" http://1.usa.gov/g3lDrk 
Danforth working towards GM Cassava capable of supplying "plant-based proteins for food, feed & industrial applications" http://1.usa.gov/g3lDrk 
So.. Nassar has found a cassava with incredible Beta-C, more than many renowned Vit A foods, eg golden sweet potato. Excellent palatability 
Gates Foundation gave Danforth another $8.3M a few days ago for it's GM cassava a few days ago http://ow.ly/4BwKo via @pdjmoo 
I'm not getting the impression the Gates funded Danforth GM cassava project is a philanthropic gesture with sole objective of African nutrition 
2004 Nassar is praised "Your work has contributed in feeding millions of Africa people.." & brought Nigeria to No1 producer http://bit.ly/hVDcYZ 
Gates funded, Monsanto-founded Danforth developing GM cassava for Nigeria and Kenya. 
And a few days ago we read how 98% of Thailand's cassava chips exported to China as biofuels http://bit.ly/fHL1kl 
For the interested, the Gates Foundation has granted $19 million to Danforth since 2008, and $70 million to the IRRI. Just in 2010/11 the money has been described as being for Vitamin A products. 
Past 'successes' of Danforth.. from GM Watch "GM cassava "our only hope"". http://www.gmwatch.org/gm-myths/11156-gm-cassava-qour-only-hopeq 
Nassar had already trumped Monsanto on cassava yields in 2006, also from GM watch: item 2 from link above http://bit.ly/eJvnzF 
Gates Foundation Officers have been drawn from Monsantohttp://www.gmwatch.org/latest-listing/1-news-items/10452-more-on-gates-foundation-tie-up-with-monsanto-front 
Madeleine Love - 21 Apr 2011 6:50:47am 
The publicly screened vision failed to identify Dr Martin Fregene as coming from the Danforth Centre.http://www.danforthcenter.org/science/programs/international_programs/bcp/participants.asp 
Was this intended to support an impression to the viewing public that he's an independent African plant geneticist unrelated to the Monsanto co-founded Danforth Centre? History: http://www.danforthcenter.org/the_center/about_us/history.asp 
The information about Dr Paul Anderson.. On the vision you've got him coming from the Danforth Centre; on the refs below he doesn't. He's on the list at the Danforth Centre; I suppose he's closely involved. 
Three scientists speaking for the product and Vice President of Monsanto's of "Consumer Benefits Platform" (as opposed to the non-consumer traits approved by FSANZ that are in our food). 
One of the few truely independent molecular biologists/geneticists has estimated they make up only 5% of the field, could be less, (Terje Traavik GenOK in Norway), so I'm not surprised if it was difficult for Catalyst to find a scientist who was not involved in making GM crops to provide alternative commentary, assuming it was sought, but it does look rather like a Monsanto advertorial... 
Perhaps Prof Jack Heinemann, leader of the biotechnology aspect of the major IAASTD project on how to feed the world http://agassessment.org and author of the book arising from the project, Hope not Hype, may have been the appropriate person to comment http://www.twnside.org.sg/title2/books/Hope.not.Hype.htm 
Next time, perhaps. 
Madeleine Love - 21 Apr 2011 5:59:42am 
No-one was more surprised than me to hear from Monsanto's Vice President of Consumer Traits, Dr David Stark, that the genes for the Monsanto GM SDA soy came from a mushroom and a petunia, because they actually came from Neurospora crassa (red bread mould)http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurospora_crassaand Primula juliae, a primula http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primula 
Going to Monsanto's application at FSANZ to verify the claims a bit too scientifically challenging for Catalyst? http://www.foodstandards.gov.au/foodstandards/applications/applicationa1041food4746.cfm 
Maybe Catalyst thought it could trust Monsanto to give it the Honest Rundown, and go for it?

All the applications shown in this piece are yet more examples of GM technology looking for a problem to solve - when there isn't one. More omega 3 rich oils? We already have them - flaxseed oils. Plentiful and easy to grow and all natural. GM Vitamin A rice? Why? If you can grow rice, you can grow naturally vitamin A rich vegetables such as cruciferous greens, pumpkins, nuts, seeds! And all of them at for the price of a few seeds. 
No health issues, no environmental pollution, no patent rights.

I can list many reasons why i personally do not support GM foods. Health & environment reasons, Multi national corporate greed reasons, socio and economic reasons, MANY reasons!... a few of which have been mentioned on the comments above. A proponent of GM foods can spin it to sound positive. But the "anti GM lobbyists" can cry as loud as we can that those problems can be solved with good old common sense, thrown in with some serious international food reform. The real problems are: the apathy of people to make changes. The too-hard basket attitude of international governments and the absolute undying willpower of a company to make a great deal of money. All arguements aside, im sure all sides will agree that GM food is IRREVERSIBLE. In fact it is entirely self perpetuating, uncontrollable, uncontainable and largely unknown. That scares me. Im scared that integrity of my organic food - which i have the right to consume - is threatened. And one more gripe: we are dumping it on the worlds poorest people to "test it out". Its totally unfair that the third world continues to be a testing ground for the first world. Why doesn't the family of Mosantos' managing directors and shareholders consume the food for a couple of decades to test it out for us, just to make sure that its ok? 
Bob Phelps - 30 Mar 2011 11:08:49pm 
Monsanto is the main corporate sponsor of the Donald Danforth Centre, also based in St Louis Missouri, so their comments were not independent of the company. Also (correct me if I'm wrong) but the African footage in this piece appeared to be a promo filmed by someone other than Catalyst, presumably Monsanto or Danforth. If so, this should have been acknowledged on screen. 
United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) figures show that since the first commercial release of GM crops in 1996, the number of starving people in the world has climbed from 788 million to 1.02 billion in 2009. The UN special Rapporteur on the right to food, Jean Ziegler, also reported that: âthe world already produces enough food to feed every child, woman and man and could feed 12 billion people, or double the current world populationâ. Everyone could eat well if the available food were fairly distributed and not wasted, but global trade sends food to market where it is most profitable, and where geopolitics dictates. 
In 2008 the World Bank and the United Nations published the International Assessment of Agricultural Science and Technology for Development (IAASTD), a vision for future farming and secure food supplies. The 400 scientists involved in the three-year project recommended core changes in agricultural practices and systems to assuage soaring food prices, hunger, social inequities and environmental catastrophe. They proposed a global shift from oil-dependent industrial agribusiness to sustainable farming systems, with research and development to augment local traditional knowledge and help farmers optimise use of soil and water resources. 
The IAASTD report also concluded that GM crops have no useful role to play in solving climate change, biodiversity loss, hunger or poverty. Fifty-eight countries adopted the IAASTDâs findings but the GM companies that helped set up the review rejected them. The Australian, United States and Canadian governments also âdid not fully approve the Executive Summary of the Synthesis Reportâ. 
A further UN report published on March 8 2011, concluded that agro-ecological farming systems can feed all the world's people well. With the oil and phosphates on which industrial farming depends getting scarce and expensive, and with climates changing, we need to change and fast. GM crops, animals and microbes are not the way of the future for food sovereignty and security. 
L Stuart - 19 Mar 2011 5:00:30am 
Your segment commenced by showing mass opposition to GM food. But nothing was mentioned why there is world wide non acceptance of GMO's and why some countries have banned growing and importing them and or the dangers associatedd with eating them such as the GMO Soy that has a transcient gene that transfer to the gut of mamals,humans and continually produces a toxin inside of us and which can be inherited by our offspring and eventually cause infertility. How organic farmers are being pushed out of business with uncontrollable cross contamination. The development of superweeds found along roadsides (GM canola and others)that are unable to be controlled. You forgot to mention the demise of the bee population and other insects that rely on plants to survive.Catalyst. your bias show will earn you no points.We are all waiting for you to show the otherside - the side that millions of people have a voice that even you wish to silence. 
Dr Timothy Billington - 27 Mar 2011 2:04:19pm 
L Stuart's assertion that a transcient(sic) gene (what ever that is!) could transfer to the gut of mamals (sic), hasn't taken account of the fact that DNA which is consumed is broken down into individual nucleotide bases by enzymes in the gut. 
We consume the genes of EVERYTHING we eat. Every cell we eat has its complement of DNA. This should be self-evident to anyone that thinks this issue through properly. 
The demise of the bee population is extremely regrettable, but is probably due to the use of pesticides, not to the existence of altered plant genomes. 
In defence of the ABC: it can safely be said that the ABC does not want to silence ANY voices. Its charter is to inform, as is exemplified by Catalyst. 
Bronwyn Winfield - 31 Mar 2011 10:14:43am 
Dr TIM, GM industry advocates claimed that genes were destroyed during the digestion of food and therefore gene transfer to gut bacteria or organs was extremely unlikely.But in the mid 1990s scientists used much more sensitive detection techniques and found that a significant percentage of DNA can survive the digestive system.Studies now verify that genes can survive digestion in both humans and animals.The old assumption of risk analysis was that horizontal gene transfer to gut bacteria was impossible and therefore the consequences need not be considered.Deceptions, Assumptions and Denial are at the roots of GM. 
Greg Revell - 31 Mar 2011 4:28:42pm 
Tim - GM constructs are artificial and inserted gene casettes can dislodge from their inserted position and move around the genome creating "DNA hotspots". The inserted gene may recombine to produce a genetic construct that may produce and unintended protein. GMOs are usually inserted with genetic "switches" (promoters) made from viral DNA. There is evidence of "horizontal gene transfer" occuring because of the CaMV (Cauliflower Mosaic virus) promoter in particular. Monsanto's GM canola has 40 "rungs" of the parent plant DNA "ladder" (base pairs) missing at one end of the new code insertion. At the other end, there are 22 new rungs but nobody knows where they came from, including Monsanto and FSANZ! Throw in a good dose of anti-biotic resistant marker genes and you've got a very good argument to avoid GM foods. 
Bronwyn Winfield - 18 Mar 2011 8:12:23pm 
This is unfortunately another example of the ABC 's promotion of GM. I would also like to see all the comments. Most are no doubt expressing disappointment in this shockingly blatant infomercial. One friend wonders how the Africans will pay Monsanto for this "special" cassava? Camel Poo? Golden rice, now theres a wonderful GM innovation. A child would have to eat 2 kgs a day or more to get enough vitamin A to prevent blindness, the same amount they would get from a spinach leaf. Permaculture can feed the world better than GM . Shame on the ABC. 
Robert - 18 Mar 2011 5:24:39pm 
I found the report about GM food very courageous and want to thank the ABC for screening it, despite the expected comments by the anti-GM lobby. 
Jenny H - 18 Mar 2011 5:09:51pm 
I was appalled at the lack of critical analysis in Dr Phillipsâ segment, âGM for Goodâ. It is not âgoodâ if each and every African farmer has to rely on Monsanto to provide their grain for the next harvest. Pests, droughts and floods can demolish Monsanto seed stores. What then? This proposal can only be sustainable if Monsanto does not patent its GM seeds. As Monsanto make no secret of the fact that their goal is to control world food supply, this is not going to happen.Dr Phillips needs to provide some real balance. There is a long history in science documenting problems with GM crops: The threat to biodiversity;Vulnerability to pest plagues; The effects on plant and bird life; The increased costs of the âimprovedâ grains. Maybe they have more protein, but it is useless if a non-GM human cannot digest it. It may be unavailable to strengthen the heart when provided in a non-natural form. If research has been done to show it is safe and useful, I would like to know about it. Dr David Starkâs claims did not reassure me. How well-informed is a doctor who tells us that blocked heart arteries do not cause death?As for Cassava with protein, there are too many unanswered questions: Will it keep as well? Will it grow in the same conditions â not just simulated drought but real-life African drought? The Monsanto improvements are designed to create a product that can be promoted as a health breakthrough, enough to take over the market. I hope Catalyst will provide a follow-up segment on the compelling science that opposes these developments. 
heather gill - 18 Mar 2011 3:56:18pm 
Bob Phelps says WHO says we can feed twice current world population well.Dr Martin Fregene says in reply "if you've never been hungry then you can get involved in all those kind of debates but if you've really been hungry then it's not an argument you know it's so clear it's so obvious", but what kind of answer is that!! I don't understand it. Did Catalyst edit out any of his reply to the WHO figure quoted?? Please be a bit more in depth with these interviews. 
Shannon O'Neill - 18 Mar 2011 11:54:40am 
MediaWatch should investigate this report, which appeared to be little more than shilling for Monsanto, a company with a horrific track record and agenda. 
Furthermore, then tone of Catalyst has recently descended into a childish style reminiscent of Behind the News. It seems to no longer belong in an evening timeslot. 
I'm very disappointed and will no longer be watching this once excellent show. 
Robin Harrison - 18 Mar 2011 11:33:54am 
A question not asked and should have been. Will the seeds be viable or will poor people in Africa be obliged to buy new seed each year, along with the copious amounts of roundup? I can already predict the answer. 
ziggy koenigseder - 18 Mar 2011 8:28:39am 
This report was very one sided and if you interview representatives of major Chemical companies like Monsanto who have much to gain,and little to lose,no wonder it all looks very positive! Check out some really good investigative books "Genetic Roulette" and "Seeds of Deception" by Jeffrey M Smith. The reputation of your, in the past, well respected program,has been badly tarnished by such an ill researched and biased report. Check the real facts, and please do another truthful report on this very important issue,when people have the facts they can make up their own mind. I fear for the future of our childrens health, this GM poison has been slowly allowed to enter our foodchain. European Countries have said NO to GM Crops and GM foods, for very good reason. So please lift your game.ziggy 
Jason, TechNyou - 22 Mar 2011 9:11:14am 
I agree that the program seemed to give too much emphasis to Monsanto's work, and this is interesting considering the significant amount of research happening in Australia's universities and CSIRO on this stuff. But to suggest people get the facts from Jeffrey Smith's books is also distortion. I suggest you check the Academics Review web site: http://academicsreview.org/Jason MajorTechNyou, University of Melbourne 
Dean Rallison - 17 Mar 2011 9:32:24pm 
I found this program extremely disappointing and not up to the usual quality I have come to expect from a Catalyst segment. More than anything it resembled an advertorial or "infomercial" for the benefit of Monsanto. It even contrasted the old "bad" Monsanto, with the new "good" Monsanto, promoting Monsanto as a reinvented organisation with the good of Subsaharan Africans at heart. This segment was not investigative, in my view it was short on science, and journalism, but long on commercial promotion of a single company with an appalling environmental and social record. 
Annie - 18 Mar 2011 9:48:10pm 
I agree wholeheartedly with your comments. We were stunned last night as we watched as Catalyst in our view took a context-free fairy-floss approach to GM and Monsanto. Catalyst appeared to be spruiking on behalf of Monsanto (a private company with a well documented history of appalling ethics and practices) under the guise of altruism (starving African people)and good nutrition (for the benefit of all). Unfortunately, Catalyst missed their opportunity to add balance to the story by additionally exploring the controversial topics of GM Foods and the strategies of the Monsanto machine. Whilst they may argue that GM has been done to death, a 'good news story' about the power-hungry Monsanto surely deserves to be balanced by an understanding of the environmental and ethical abuses they have also inflicted on the same vulnerable people they now claim to be helping. Monsanto is far from being the saviour of the developing world and the audience should be able to qualify the information presented on Catalyst in context. 
BJC - 17 Mar 2011 9:14:08pm 
Did Monsanto pay for any of the costs for the report o into Gm foods on Catalyst tonight ? 
Moderator: Thank you for your question. The ABC is an independent broadcaster with a remit to deliver accurate information in an unbiased manner. As such, we do not accept payment for any of the stories we cover. 
Bob Phelps - 31 Mar 2011 3:05:35pm 
Was Dr Phillips invited to St Louis Missouri or did the ABC request the trip and interviews? Was this story the sole purpose for his visit to the USA or did he have other reasons for traveling there? Did the ABC pay all travel, accommodation, equipment and other costs for Dr Phillips and his film crew during this trip? Did he use any footage supplied by Monsanto, Danforth or other entity in the story and, if so, why was this not disclosed to viewers? Did he interview any critics of Monsanto, Danforth or their programs, including the cassava project, while overseas? Why was the close connection between Monsanto and Danforth not disclosed in the story? What scientific evidence exists that the GM oil and cassava mentioned in the program can achieve the results claimed for them? 
Catalyst - 14 Apr 2011 10:03:51am 
Dr Phillips visit to Monsanto was at the request of the Catalyst Production unit. The story was just one of four diverse stories covered during Grahams trip to the USA last November. The ABC covered all allowable expenses for the trip, including flights and accommodation. No vision was supplied by either Monsanto or Danforth in the production of the story. You, Bob Phelps, were the only critic of GM food interviewed for this story. Your extended interview is published at our website. The story did use around 15 seconds of Monsanto handout footage near the top of the piece. Yes it would have been a good idea to have credited that footage to Monsanto. We will fix up the video as soon as we can. In such a short piece, designed to look at the possible benefits of GM foods, it was not possible to report comprehensively on all aspects of GM food production. Graham Phillips will soon be producing a piece of similar length that will investigate the claims made against GM foods and its producers. You can expect this story to appear on Catalyst before the end of the current series. Thank you for your assistance with our research. Catalyst.

Our committee was given the task of examining the evidence regarding potential negative effects and benefits of currently commercialized genetically engineered (GE) crops and the potential benefits and negative effects of future GE crops. In carrying out this study, the committee members and I were well aware of the controversial nature of genetic engineering in the United States and globally. Before and during the committee’s first meeting, we received comments from people and groups expressing the view that the scientific evidence establishing the safety of current GE crops was so solid and well-reviewed that the only potentially useful task for the committee would be to examine emerging genetic-engineering technologies. We considered those comments but believed that available analyses were not complete and up to date and that an examination of the data on diverse biological and societal aspects of both current and future GE crops would therefore be useful. We received other comments indicating that research studies that found adverse biological or social effects of GE crops had been ignored, and because of our committee’s composition, we too would probably ignore them. We took all of the comments as constructive challenges. 
Our committee embraced the National Academies consensus-study process, which requires that “efforts are made to solicit input from individuals who have been directly involved in, or who have special knowledge of, the problem under consideration” and that a study “report should show that the committee has considered all credible views on the topics it addresses, whether or not those views agree with the committee’s final positions. Sources must not be used selectively to justify a preferred outcome.” We listened to presentations from 80 people who had diverse expertise, experi- 
Suggested Citation:"Front Matter." National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2016. Genetically Engineered Crops: Experiences and Prospects. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/23395. 
ence, and perspectives on GE crops to augment the diversity represented on the committee; they are listed in Appendixes C and D. We also received and read more than 700 comments and documents sent to us from individuals and organizations about specific risks and benefits that could be associated with GE crops and their accompanying technologies. Beyond those sources of information, our committee carefully examined literature—peer-reviewed and nonreviewed—relevant to benefits and risks associated with GE crops in the United States and elsewhere. 
Although it is true that articles exist that summarize much of the literature on GE crops, we committed ourselves to taking a fresh look at the primary literature itself. Our major goal in writing this report was to make available to the public, to researchers, and to policy-makers a comprehensive review of the evidence that has been used in the debates about GE crops and information on relevant studies that are rarely referred to in the debates. Given the immense literature on GE crops, we suspect that we missed some relevant articles and specific results. 
We received a number of broad comments that asked us to examine and make judgments about the merits of technology-intensive agriculture compared with more agroecological approaches. That would be an important comparison but was beyond the scope of the specific task given to the committee. 
We recognized that some members of the public are skeptical of the literature on GE crops because of concerns that many experiments and results have been conducted or influenced by the industries that are profiting from these crops. Therefore, when we referred to articles in the three major chapters (4, 5, and 6) of the report regarding current GE crops, we identified the affiliations of their primary authors and, when possible, the specific sources of their funding. That information is available on our study’s website (http://nas-sites.org/ge-crops/). 
To make the basis of each of our report’s conclusions accessible, we developed a user-friendly interface on the website that can be queried for each specific finding and recommendation in the report. The interface takes a user to the text in the report that culminated in each finding or recommendation. A second interface on the website has a summary list of the comments and questions that were sent to us by the public or brought up in formal presentations; this interface enables a user to read how the committee addressed a specific comment or question. 
We worked hard to analyze the existing evidence on GE crops, and we made recommendations based on our findings; ultimately, however, decisions about how to govern new crops need to be made by societies. There is an indisputable case for regulations to be informed by accurate scientific information, but history makes clear that solely “science-based regulation” 
Suggested Citation:"Front Matter." National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2016. Genetically Engineered Crops: Experiences and Prospects. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/23395. 
is rare and not necessarily desirable. As a small example, how would science alone decide on how important it is to prevent a decline in monarch butterfly populations? 
We received impassioned requests to give the public a simple, general, authoritative answer about GE crops. Given the complexity of the issues, we did not see that as appropriate. However, we hope that we have given the public and policy-makers abundant evidence and a framework to inform their decisions about individual agricultural products. 
In 1999, Secretary of Agriculture Dan Glickman gave a speech1 about biotechnology in which he stated that “with all that biotechnology has to offer, it is nothing if it’s not accepted. This boils down to a matter of trust. Trust in the science behind the process, but particularly trust in the regulatory process that ensures thorough review—including complete and open public involvement.” Trust must be based on more than authority and appealing arguments for or against genetic engineering. In this regard, while we recognize that no individual report can be completely balanced, we offer our report as a sincere effort at thoroughness and openness in examining the evidence related to prevalent claims about GE crops. 
ACKNOWLEDGMENTS 
First and foremost, our committee is grateful to Kara Laney, our study director. Without her perseverance, dedication to excellence, amazing grasp of the literature, writing skills, and talent for coaxing the best possible efforts from committee members, this report would have been a shadow of itself. Jenna Briscoe provided incredible behind-the-scenes support for everything that the committee did. Janet Mulligan, our senior program associate for research, enabled access to nearly inaccessible documents and kept incoming public comments and articles organized. Maria Oria, a senior program officer with the National Academies Food and Nutrition Board, provided expert assistance with food-safety sections of the report. Norman Grossblatt substantially improved the language in our report. We thank Robin Schoen, director of the Board on Agriculture and Natural Resources, for encouraging the committee to abandon preconceived notions, listen to diverse voices, and dig deeply into the evidence regarding risks and benefits associated with GE crops. The committee’s thinking was challenged, broadened, and deepened by the many people who participated in committee meetings and webinars and the organizations and individuals that

Genetically engineered (GE) crops were first introduced commercially in the 1990s. After two decades of production, some groups and individuals remain critical of the technology based on their concerns about possible adverse effects on human health, the environment, and ethical considerations. At the same time, others are concerned that the technology is not reaching its potential to improve human health and the environment because of stringent regulations and reduced public funding to develop products offering more benefits to society. While the debate about these and other questions related to the genetic engineering techniques of the first 20 years goes on, emerging genetic-engineering technologies are adding new complexities to the conversation. 
Genetically Engineered Crops builds on previous related Academies reports published between 1987 and 2010 by undertaking a retrospective examination of the purported positive and adverse effects of GE crops and to anticipate what emerging genetic-engineering technologies hold for the future. This report indicates where there are uncertainties about the economic, agronomic, health, safety, or other impacts of GE crops and food, and makes recommendations to fill gaps in safety assessments, increase regulatory clarity, and improve innovations in and access to GE technology.

Abstract
For the current generation of genetically modified (GM) crops the improvement of agronomic traits (e.g. herbicide
tolerance, insect resistance) has been a major objective. The lack of obvious and direct benefits for the consumer has
been a main point of criticism. Future trends will increasingly encompass the modification of quality traits, such as
the improvement of sensory and especially nutritional properties. Some of the ongoing developments try to meet the
desire of consumers for ‘healthy’ or ‘high-tech’ foods in developed countries. Others are intended to assist in adjusting
the nutritional status of foods to the needs of consumers in developing countries. Considering the increasing world
population and the limited amount of arable land, GM technology may also become a valuable tool to ensure food
security. The major prerequisite for the applicability of the technique is the safety of the resulting products. The
increasing complexity of modifications intended might require adjustments and improvements of the strategies applied
to the safety assessment of GM foods. Present research activities try to meet these new challenges. © 2002 Published

1. Introduction
Within a rather short period of time genetic
engineering has evolved from basic science to
commercial applications. The use of this versatile
tool of modern biotechnology has become a
multibillion-dollar business (Malik, 1999). Considering the important role of fermentation technology in traditional food production, it was not
surprising that the area of foods and food ingredi* Corresponding author. Fax: + 49-8161-714259.

ents attracted the interest of genetic engineers
from the very beginning. One of the first commercial examples was the production of the cheesemaking enzyme chymosin, traditionally obtained
from calves, by fermentation using genetically
modified (GM) microorganisms (Flamm, 1994).
The techniques developed for transformations of
plants were readily applied to crops and GM
plants used for food production are now a reality
(James, 2000).
Starting from 1.7 million ha in 1996, the global
area of transgenic crops significantly increased to
44.2 million ha in 2000. However, interpretation
of these total numbers has to take into account

that present applications of recombinant DNA
techniques focus on few plants and few traits. The
spectrum of commercialized transgenic crops is
essentially limited to soybean, corn, cotton and
canola. Ninety-three percent of the GM crops
planted exhibit herbicide tolerance and insect resistance as target traits (James, 2000). These applications may be useful to the growers but they
seem of no direct and obvious benefit for consumers. This is one of the reasons for the low
acceptance of foods derived from genetically
modified organisms (GMO) and the continuing
public debate on this technology.
The objectives of this contribution are: (i) to
review the current and potential applications of
GM in food production; (ii) to outline present and
future benefits of GM crops; and (iii) to discuss
challenges in safety assessment evolving from new
developments in this field.

2. Applications

2.1. Agronomic traits
2.1.1. Herbicide tolerance
The application of herbicides is an indispensable part of modern agriculture. If weeds are not
controlled, they may account for crop losses ranging from 20 to 60%. Tolerance of crops to herbicides has been achieved either (i) by introducing a
gene coding for a target enzyme insensitive to the
herbicide (Padgette et al., 1996) or (ii) by introducing a gene encoding an enzyme metabolizing
and thus detoxifying the herbicide (Rasche et al.,
1995).
Tolerance to glyphosate (Roundup Ready) and
glufosinate (BASTA), respectively, are the commercially most relevant applications. Herbicidetolerant plants are grown on 74% of the global
area of transgenic crops. Herbicide-tolerant soybean was the most dominant (59%) transgenic
crop grown in six countries (USA, Argentina,
Canada, Mexico, Romania and Uruguay) in 2000
(James, 2000).
Major benefits of growing herbicide-tolerant
crops are increased yields and reduced costs.
Moisture loss and soil erosion can be minimized

by non-tillage farming. Roundup Ready and
BASTA are favorable in terms of mammalian
safety and environmental properties (Padgette et
al., 1996).

2.1.2. Insect resistance
The commercially second most important trait
conferred to crops by genetic engineering is insectresistance. Plants expressing d-endotoxins from
Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) have been grown on
19% of the global area of transgenic crops (James,
2000). This strategy has been applied to confer
insect-resistance to crops such as canola, corn,
cotton and potato. Major benefits exhibited by
Bt-resistant plants comprise improved crop yields,
reduced use of chemical insecticides (Xia et al.,
1999), reduced levels of fungal toxins (Munkvold
et al., 1997) and preservation or enhancement of
populations of beneficial insects (Betz et al., 2000).
In order to minimize the development of resistance to Bt toxin, field management practices such
as maintenance of refuges are applied (Mandaokar et al., 1999).
Alternative strategies to confer insect resistance
to plants, which might become of practical importance in the future have been described (Schuler et
al., 1998). They include the expression of lectines
(Down et al., 1996), proteinase inhibitors (Leplé et
al., 1995), a-amylase inhibitors (Altabella and
Chrispeels, 1990) or cholesterol oxidase (Cho et
al., 1995).
2.1.3. Resistance to 6iruses, fungi and bacteria
Protection against viral diseases has been
achieved by expressing viral coat proteins or by
introducing viral replicase genes (Galun and Breiman, 1997). Resistance to fungi is conferred by
GM-induced biosynthesis of phytoalexins, by the
expression of cell wall-hydrolyzing enzymes (chitinases, b-glucanases) or expression of ribosomal
inhibitor proteins specific to fungal ribosomes
(Malik, 1999). Resistance to fungi is beneficial not
only from a commercial point of view (yield) but
also considering the reduction in mycotoxin levels.
Various strategies ranging from expression of antibacterial enzymes (Düring, 1996) to engineered
detoxification (Zhang, 1999) have been described
to confer resistance to bacteria.

K.-H. Engel et al. / Toxicology Letters 127 (2002) 329–336

The present improvements of agronomic properties are tailored to the needs of agriculture in
developed countries. Traits such as pest- and disease-resistance are also of outstanding importance to developing countries. This becomes very
evident if one considers that more than 15% of
the world’s crops are lost by insect damage and
this happens mostly in developing countries.
However, in order to contribute really to food
security, biotechnological developments will have
to focus on crops important in developing countries, e.g. cassava and rice (Puonti-Kaerlas et al.,
1999).

2.1.4. Other agronomic traits
Additional strategies to improve crop productivity especially in developing countries are based
on increasing crop tolerance to abiotic stress as
evoked by the rough environmental conditions.
2.1.4.1. Drought resistance. The expression of the
full genetic potential of a plant (e.g. maximum
yield) is seriously affected by the inadequacy of
water. Pathways involving the biosynthesis of
metabolites like polyamines, proline, glycine betaine and trehalose were shown to be related to
drought resistance (Mitra, 2001).
2.1.4.2. Effects of metals. Thirty percent of
arable land is characterized by the poor solubility of iron due to the alkaline soil. The resulting
limitation of plant growth cannot be alleviated
by fertilizers. The tolerance of rice to such low
iron availability in alkaline soils could be improved by genetically engineering the crop to
release more iron-solubilizing chelators (Takahashi et al., 2001).
Aluminum released by acid soils is toxic to
crop roots. Thirty to forty percent of the world’s
arable land is affected by acid soils resulting in
yield losses of up to 80%. Expression of bacterial
citrate synthase in roots is one of the strategies
presently being developed to overcome this problem (De la Fuente et al., 1997).
2.1.4.3. Salinity. Forty percent of the irrigated
land is affected by salinity. The resulting decline
in photosynthesis and the increased formation of

331

oxygen radicals limits the crop performance. Genetic engineering can be used to increase the
cellular content of osmolytes (Karakas, 1997), to
express antioxidative enzymes (Van Breusegem et
al., 1999), or to introduce sodium pumps (Apse
et al., 1999).

2.2. Quality traits
In industrialized countries the improvement of
the agronomic performance of crops does not
appear as a direct benefit to the customer purchasing the food in the super market. In order
to convince the consumer on the advantage of
genetic engineering and thus to increase the acceptance of GM foods, ‘obvious’ traits such as
sensory or nutritional properties have to be
improved.

2.2.1. Sensory properties
The FLAVR SAVR™ tomato, the first transgenic crop put on the market in the US (Redenbaugh et al., 1995) exhibited delayed ripening
due to anti-sense inhibition of polygalacturonase,
a key enzyme involved in the softening of cell
walls. Unfortunately, this trait was mainly propagated as a means to increase the shelf life of
tomatoes. The potentially positive effect on the
flavor implied in the commercial name has actually not been exploited. Other strategies trying to
improve the flavor characteristics interfere with
the metabolism of ethylene, e.g. by anti-sense
inhibition of the 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid oxidase via anti-sense (Ayub et al.,
1996). Approaches that are more recent are intended to modify enzyme-catalyzed steps in the
biosynthesis of specific flavor and aroma constituents. Examples are the genetic engineering of
essential oil production in mint (Lange and
Croteau, 1999) or the modification of lipoxygenase (Griffiths et al., 1999) and alcohol dehydrogenase (Prestage et al., 1999) involved in the
formation of C6-compounds by degradation of
unsaturated fatty acid precursors. Considering
the role of biotechnology in the production of
flavors (Krings and Berger, 1998), the use of
modified microorganisms (Rijnen et al., 2000)
will be of an increasing importance.

332

K.-H. Engel et al. / Toxicology Letters 127 (2002) 329–336

2.2.2. Nutritional properties
The next wave of applications of recombinant
DNA techniques in food production will be characterized by approaches to improve the
nutritional properties of raw materials and the
foods made thereof (Kochian and Garvin,
1999). Genetic engineering can be applied to modify macronutrients as well as micronutrients in
foods.
2.2.2.1. Macronutrients. Genetic engineering of
lipid metabolism in oil crops is being driven by
the demand for oils and fats as raw material for
the chemical industry as well as by the key role of
edible fats and oils in the human diet (Gunstone,
1999; Murphy, 1999). Modification of the chain
lengths and the degree of saturation of fatty acids
has resulted in commercialized products, such as
high laurate canola oil (Del Vecchio, 1996; Friedt
and Lühs, 1998) and sunflower seed oil with high
oleic acid content (Kinney and Knowlton, 1998).
Designing the lipid content of edible oils according to health benefits will be one of the major
trends in the near future (Vageeshbabu and Chopra, 1999).
Various strategies have been described to improve the protein quality of foods and feeds (De
Lumen et al., 1997; Roller and Harlander, 1998).
This ranges from functional properties, e.g. baking quality of wheat (Vail and Anderson, 1997;
Anderson and Blechl, 2000), to nutritional properties, e.g. enhancement of the content of essential
amino acids. The attempt to increase the methionine content of soybeans by expressing a protein
from Brazil nut resulted in the unintended transfer of the allergenic protein (Nordlee et al., 1996).
On the other hand, enzyme inhibition via antisense technique may also be applied to reduce the
allergenic potential of crops as demonstrated for
rice (Tada, 1996).
Modern plant biotechnology has focused very
early on the genetic modification of plant carbohydrate metabolism (Petersen et al., 1995). Influencing source– sink interactions, improving starch
biosynthesis, changing starch composition or accumulating fructanes in transgenic crops are examples for relevant applications (Turk and
Smeekens, 1999).

2.2.2.2. Micronutrients. The wide range of isoprenoids found in plants and the integration of
metabolic pathways of steroids, carotenoids and
retinoids (Gawienowski, 1999) offers the potential
to influence the content of these compounds by
genetic engineering. An exciting current example
is the genetically engineered biosynthesis of bcarotene in the so-called ‘Golden Rice’ (Ye et al.,
2000). The presence of this provitamin in a major
food might help prevent vitamin A deficiencies in
considerable parts of the population in Southeast
Asia.
Overexpression of g-tocopherol methyltransferase in Arabidopsis seeds demonstrated the potential to shift the tocopherol distribution in oil in
favor of the desired a-tocopherol, the essential
component (vitamin E) in mammalian diets (Shintani and DellaPenna, 2000).
It has been estimated that about 1.3 billion
people suffer from iron deficiency. In order to
increase the iron content of rice, the major staple
food in Asia, three approaches have been proposed: (i) introduction of the ferritin gene from
Phaseolus 6ulgaris into rice; (ii) expression of a
heat-tolerant phytase from Aspergillus fumigatus;
and (iii) overexpression of endogenous cysteinrich metallothionein-like protein (Lucca et al.,
2000).
Owing to the present wave of ‘functional foods’
increasingly put on the market in Western countries, there is increasing interest in bioactive plant
constituents. Modifying composition and distribution of high-value compounds, such as
carotenoids and vitamins (Hirschberg, 1999) or
flavonoids and isoflavonoids (Mounts et al., 1996;
Dixon and Steele, 1999) may become ‘gold mines’
for metabolic engineering.
2.3. GM microorganisms
Owing to the important role of fermented foods
in diets all over the world, microorganisms are
ubiquitously applied to food production and
preparation. By means of genetic engineering, the
properties of microorganisms, e.g. starter cultures,
can be changed more precisely than by random
mutagenesis and subsequent selection procedures
based on classical bacteriological and genetic

K.-H. Engel et al. / Toxicology Letters 127 (2002) 329–336

methods. Major goals are optimization of the
production process, improvement of product
quality and safety (hygienic status) and enlargement of product diversity (IFT, 2000).
The broad spectrum of fermentation processes
applied in food production and the important role
of microorganisms in functional foods (e.g. probiotics) demonstrate the enormous potential of genetic engineering for improving microorganisms
used in food industry. GM microorganisms will
be used to produce enzymes with optimized properties regarding activity, specificity or stability
(Roller and Goodenough, 1999).

2.4. GMO as bioreactors
Genetic engineering will indirectly open the way
for many new technologies. In addition to microorganisms, plants and animals will be increasingly seen as ‘bioreactors’ enabling the production
of broad-spectrum food ingredients, food additives or food contact materials. These may either
be ‘nature-identical’ or ‘tailor-made’ in order to
meet the needs of a certain product specifically.
The strategy to express enzymes involved in the
conversion of starch to fructose and normally
used in the technological process in the potato
tuber is an example of the developments to be
expected in the future (Beaujean et al., 2000).

3. Food safety assessment of GM crops

3.1. Present approaches
The principle of ‘substantial equivalence’ elaborated in several international consultations since
the beginning of the 1990s (WHO, 1991, 1995;
OECD, 1993) became a key element in the safety
assessment of foods derived from GMO. The
concept is used to identify similarities and differences between the GM food and a comparator
with a history of safe use that subsequently guides
the safety assessment process (WHO, 2000). It
proved to be suitable for the first generation of
GM crops. Foods consisting of or containing
GMO belong to the best-analyzed foods we know.
So far, there are no documented reports on ad-

333

verse effects on humans resulting from the consumption of food produced by means of
recombinant DNA techniques. Nevertheless, the
safety assessment approach is subjected to criticism and controversial discussion. Contemporary
and future activities have to take arguments forwarded into account and contribute to the development of science-based adjustments and
improvements, especially in the light of the next
generation of GM foods to be expected.

3.2. Future challenges
As outlined in the above sections, the next
generation of GM foods will not be limited to
plants with agronomic advantages but will increasingly focus on improvements of the nutritional properties of a crop. These GMO with
‘added values’ will cross the borderline between
GM foods and ‘functional foods’.
The complexity of metabolic changes in GM
crops will increase. The establishment of ‘substantial equivalence’ to a counterpart with an accepted
standard of safety will become more difficult.
Therefore, the need to perform comprehensive
safety and nutritional assessment of ‘novel foods’
will increase. As feeding studies with whole foods
will be requested more often, a refinement of these
approaches will be needed. The development of
early in vitro/in vivo biomarkers for toxicity
might be useful.
The safety assessment of GM foods will have to
go beyond the assessment of the single product as
such and will have to encompass the overall impact of the food to the nutritional status of the
population. The assessment of the intake of critical nutrients will be of increasing importance. The
different situations in developed and developing
countries will have to be taken into account.

3.3. Examples for current research acti6ities
In the course of the fifth framework program
the EU Commission financially supports research
projects related to the safety assessment of GM
foods. They cover subjects such as: (i) ‘New methods for safety testing of transgenic food’
(SAFOTEST, QLK1-19999-00651); (ii) ‘New

334

K.-H. Engel et al. / Toxicology Letters 127 (2002) 329–336

methodologies for assessing the potential of unintended effects in GM crops’ (GMOCARE,
QLK1-19999-00765); (iii) ‘Safety evaluation of
horizontal gene transfer from GMO to the microflora of the food chain and human gut’
(GMOBILITY, QLK1-19999-00527); and (iv)
‘Reliable, standardized, specific, quantitative detection of GM foods’ (QPCRGMOFOOD,
QLK1-19999-01301).
Cluster coordination of the projects is achieved
through the European Network: ‘Safety Assessment of Genetically Modified Foods’ (ENTRANSFOOD). In this thematic network four
working groups related to the research projects
have been established in which contributors from
academia, industry, regulatory organizations and
consumer groups elaborate reviews, position papers and integrated evaluation documents and
prepare recommendations and research proposals
related to the safety assessment of GM foods.

4. Outlook
Considering the expected increase in world’s
population, food security will be one of the major
social issues in the coming decades. Food production will have to be at least doubled to meet the
needs. The potential of genetic engineering to
assist in meeting this challenge is far from being
fully exploited. For example, cereal grains (mainly
wheat, rice and maize) account for approximately
half of the calories consumed by humans. However, the practical use of transgenic cereals is still
in its infancy (O’Brien and Henry, 2000).
Nearly 70% of poor and food-insecure people
live in rural areas in developing countries. Low
production in agriculture is a major cause of
poverty, food insecurity and poor nutrition. Genetic engineering can help: (i) facilitate agricultural and rural growth through high-yielding
varieties resistant to biotic and abiotic stresses; (ii)
reduce pest-associated losses; (iii) support environment-friendly production technologies; and
(iv) enable precision agriculture, i.e. use of right
inputs at the right time (Sharma et al., 2001).
However, in order to achieve these goals, the
application of genetic engineering has to be

adapted to the specific issued related to local
crops in developing countries (Atkinson et al.,
2001; Herrera-Estrella, 2000; Wambugu, 1999).
Recombinant DNA techniques should be increasingly used to improve the nutritional status of
crops essential for the population in developing
countries.
In industrialized countries the global area of
transgenic crops has been reaching a plateau
phase (James, 2000). Despite its obvious and
broad potential (Halford and Shewry, 2000; IFT,
2000; Uzogara, 2000), consumers are increasingly
reluctant to accept the technology as a standard
tool in modern food production. Maybe the desire
for health-promoting or disease-resisting food
(functional food) and the possibility to use genetic
engineering for these targeted improvements, will
eventually pave the way for broader acceptance.
The discussion on the application of recombinant DNA techniques should be actively used for
science-based education of consumers on traditional procedures applied in the production of
foods. Difficulties in convincing consumers about
the advantage of applying genetic engineering are
very often due to idealized and unrealistic opinions on the classical methods (automatically considered as safe) used in conventional food
production. Transparency in traditional food processing as well as in the application of modern
techniques would help in increasing the understanding, and eventually also contribute to food
