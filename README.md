# multilevel_corpus

Corpus linguistic data and analysis for research purposes. Three distinct corpora were constructed. Each corpus is aimed at a level of communication, so there is a textual, verbal, and a nonverbal corpus. Also, each corpus corresponds to an overall environmental theme. The themes covered are genetically modified (GM) seed, the Dakota Access Pipeline (a natural gas infrastructure project), and mining.

| Corpus | Themes                                        | Data                                                                                                                              |
|--------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1      | Genetically modified (GM) seed                | Texts collected from the web; categorized into 2 sub-corpora representing pro- and anti- sides of the debate                      |
| 2      | Dakota Access Pipeline (natural gas pipeline) | Quotations, parsed from web articles, with speaker identities; categorized into 3 groups depending on the position of the speaker |
|        | Mining & Resource Extraction                  | Video interviews and documentaries; transcripts recorded and nonverbal annotation applied to selected segments                    |

The aim was conduct an analysis of each corpus (1 to 3) in a way that proceeds from the general to the specific. Analysis 1 looks at broad themes from the perspective of the entire texts. Analyses 2 and 3 proceed to sentences, phrases, and even the phonetic and syllaballic components of linguistic data. The three levels of discourse are applied to each corpus. In other words, each the three analyses is split into ecological, cultural, socio-economic, and cognitive levels.

Research findings for Analysis 1 are published in the journal [Discourse & Society](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/09579265211023234). An article with findings for Analysis 2 is currently under review.
