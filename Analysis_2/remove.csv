about how the people have the right to overthrow the government if it abuses its power. Who said that?,
"Rattler told me in the previous weeks, on two occasions, two different unmarked cars pulled up beside him on the street and a passenger brandished a Glock 10 before the vehicles sped away. He said that numerous local residents have driven by and yelled, “Go home!” while he smoked on the porch.  “It’s funny, because I want to get out of here, too,” he said. “But part of me wants to yell back, ‘Go home? We were here first!’” He’s staying at the home of a member of the local Unitarian Church, a small detached house near the center of Bismarck in a row of small detached houses, in organized, anonymous, suburban-looking blocks.I came to North Dakota three months after the February eviction. There was all but no sign of the once sprawling camps that had stood 40 miles south of Bismarck. You have to look hard for relics left on the wind beaten, sand-brown grass, like a lone cinder block bearing “#NoDAPL” in black spray paint, or razor wire piled up in a mound by the 1806 Highway, gleaming in the sun. Riot police had used the wire to surround and block off a sacred burial site named Turtle Island after water protectors crossed near-freezing water to pray there in November.I traveled to the site with Freeman and some of her co-workers. An ebullient paralegal named Jess in gold eye-shadow and a floral skirt pointed out where the various camp areas had stood. She hadn’t returned to the site since the February eviction. Nor had Dandilion Cloverdale, a sex worker and educator from Montana who now works for the Freshet Collective in North Dakota to coordinate travel and lodging for defendants. Cloverdale walked around solemnly, eyes streaming from the winds blowing sideways on the plains. “It’s sad coming back here, it looks so different” they said, adding “it’s hard,” a phrase I heard like a refrain that trip.Cloverdale had been the camp manager for the small Two Spirit Nation camp at Standing Rock, which brought together the intersection of the indigenous and LBGTQ struggle and many Two Spirit youth.  “Before the occupation there were two teen suicides a month on this reservation” said Cloverdale. “During the occupation, there were none. There was promise and hope, young people believed in themselves.” Native teens and young adults are 1.5 times as likely to kill themselves as the national average. The Standing Rock movement’s guiding words, Mni Wiconi (water is life) meant more than clean water advocacy. Water protectors and land defenders see themselves in a struggle to affirm and sustain life, which is as much spiritual as it is material and environmental.Not all the lawyers and organizers are in North Dakota full-time like Freeman; some come for a few weeks at a time for hearings and meetings—a semi-rotating cast of legal activists, who join the close quarters of the Mandan office and apartments. Most nights they cook and eat vegan food together, crammed into Freeman’s temporary living room on two sofas and the floor. Files and paperwork take up every table surface, with extension cords and wires from four to five laptops at a time snaking around the sparse furniture. Outside of their temporary lodgings, the Freshet and WPLC workers stand out in white Trump country; their ranks include Native Americans, gender nonconforming and queer individuals, trendy New Yorkers and what your grandparents might call hippies. “I was picking someone up from Bismarck airport,” Cloverdale told me, “and a group of white folks told me ‘you need to go home.’ They don’t like out-of-towners around here; they give dirty looks to out of state [license] plates.”Freeman concurred. “I’ve never had to work as a defense attorney and endure this kind of hostile environment,” she said. A longtime activist lawyer, she noted that “unlike movements we’ve seen recently, there’s not a robust well of attorneys here. And the court system could have never anticipated this.”The state Supreme Court deemed the situation an “emergency affecting the legal system of North Dakota.” Seventy defense lawyers from all over the state have been appointed to cases; “typically they live and work about four hours away,” Freeman said. But only about ten local defense council are working directly with the WPLC. With only so many barred criminal defense attorneys in North Dakota, a number of whom expressed negative bias against water protectors, the state has had to change its rules to let out-of-state lawyers practice in the Standing Rock cases in what’s known as a pro hac vice capacity. Pro hac vice lawyers must work with a barred North Dakota counsel—the local lawyers working with the WPLC are currently serving as local counsel for around 40 to 45 out-of-state lawyers.North Dakota as a whole has an entrenched conservative bent with Republicans in firm control of the state house and executive. Local landowners and residents in the surrounding rural areas described the camps as a source of disruption, crime and vandalism.“These were situations and circumstances we’d never seen before. It was emotionally, physically and economically taxing to the community,” said Julie Ellingson, the executive vice president of the North Dakota Stockmen’s association, a trade organization which represents livestock producers. “This is a quiet, agricultural area; the largest cattle producing county in the state,” said Ellingson, who has lived in the area all her life. She told me that during the time of the camps, livestock producers couldn’t move their cattle from field to field, faced protest-related roadblocks, and an alleged uptick in stolen, injured and killed animals. On top of a uniquely brutal winter, these were unwelcome interruptions, which provoked ire against protesters, but not the pipeline that drew them to North Dakota. Ellingson was one among a number of local residents who told me that they believed the pipeline construction abided by relevant laws, regulations and necessary agreements—a view challenged by the (equally local) Standing Rock Sioux and their recent federal court victory over the lack of adequate environmental studies and adherence to treaty protections.",X
"This is a threatening environment.”(In the first week of September, after months of filing motions and waiting, Freeman received the news from the Court that Rattler’s bond conditions would be relaxed to allow him to leave Bismarck to live somewhere else—somewhere approved by the court—while awaiting trial. Out of concern for his safety, Freeman does not want to make details of his next location public.)Erickson, the state’s attorney known for theatrical language in court and chain smoking outside of it, told me that “the fatigue the whole area felt, it got raw.” A striking admission from a prosecutor about the risk of local bias. If the whole area was affected, I asked, how could impartial jurors be found for all these cases? “It’s challenging,” he admitted, before asserting swiftly that fair juries were nonetheless being found. He stressed that, contrary to charges of racism in the area against Indians, his Native American friends (“my guys” as he called them) in the sheriff’s department were also burned out by the camps. The same state’s attorney filed motions in December to disallow defendants from mentioning the following in court: “historical treaties between the U.S. Government and the Sioux Nation; tribal sovereignty; the merits and demerits of the Dakota Access Pipeline; climate change; sacred sites.” Erickson argued these issues had “no relevance” to the criminal cases at hand. If an individual defendant did want to raise the fact that 99 percent of the arrests took place on land accorded to the Lakota tribe in either the 1851 or 1858 Fort Laramie treaties, the point would have little legal traction. But if these treaties—harsh compromises in and of themselves—were truly respected, none of these trials would be happening: state and federal powers have no jurisdiction on treaty land.  If they had been historically respected, they would be no DAPL in the first place. The grim irony that many of the arrests led to trespass charges for natives on what should be their land is one that animates the history of this country. The attorney noted that there is hardly anywhere to bring an argument from a sovereign nation’s claim—international courts are not going to weigh in on the Standing Rock criminal trials. But according to the lawyers I spoke to, including Bruce Ellison, a veteran attorney who represented AIM leaders after the 1973 standoff and continues to represent Leonard Peltier as well as a number of Standing Rock defendants, many of the cases are eminently defensible on points of law and proof, regardless of a treaty defense. The challenge is to defend what they believe to be defensible in this tough rural context with only a small legal operation handling hundreds of cases.After a group dinner in her living room one night, Freeman and I sat in her equally jumbled adjoining bedroom. “In these cases we have both law and proof on our side. But really,” she said, with a quiver to her voice, “it’s the righteousness of it.”In early July, Freshet published a tally of case statistics. Six hundred and four state cases were unresolved (517 open cases, 85 warrants issued and two cases going through appeal), with charges ranging from minor disorderly conduct violations to felony arson and assault on an officer. One hundred and fourteen people have already taken plea deals instead of traveling back to Bismarck—no small journey for activists coming from all around the country to face the possible risk of an unsympathetic jury. There had been eight convictions and three not-guilty rulings; the courts will take well over a year to get through the caseload. But by early August, prosecutors, lacking witnesses, evidence, and appropriate paperwork by arresting officers, began to dismiss cases by the dozen, often at the eleventh hour as court dates approach, but hundreds remain.“In these cases we have both law and proof on our side. But really,” she said, with a quiver to her voice, “it’s the righteousness of it.”Accounting for every arrestee and finding each defendant appropriate representation has been a mammoth task in and of itself, and one that is not yet complete. In the meantime, Freshet and WPLC are working with the local lawyers and building collective defense strategies around major days of mass arrests—like October 27—from which scores of protesters face similar charges, while allegations of infirm arrest and police brutality are high. And for the prosecutors, mass arrest days, which involved law enforcement officers from around the country and state, are proving a challenge. At the time of writing, over 168 charges have been outright dismissed by prosecutors before even attempting to extract pleas or go to trial, evidencing the illegitimacy of these charges in the first place. “The prosecution is realizing that they can't make out the elements of the charged offenses,” said Moira Meltzer-Cohen, a New-York based attorney who travels back and forth to North Dakota to represent nine defendants with cases in state court in Mandan. “Some of their cases have been dismissed by judges, and also because, having brought in law enforcement from all over the country, those extra-jurisdictional cops made arrests, failed to complete any meaningful paperwork, went home, and are not keen to return to testify about something that happened in a chaotic environment months ago,” she said, noting that without evidence showing individualized probable cause and without witnesses, the prosecution has been dismissing charges, which should have never been brought. Meltzer-Cohen, whom I’ve known for many years through her work on activist cases in New York, called the legal situation “a mess.”The fact that numerous cases have already been dismissed, and juries have delivered not-guilty verdicts in three cases already, including those of Standing Rock Sioux Tribal Chairman Dave Archambault and Tribal Councilman Dana Yellow Fat gives hope to the defense attorneys. Local paper, the Bismarck Tribune, which skewed dramatically against protesters and in favor of law enforcement in its editorial pages took the acquittals as an occasion to opine that “the system works for everyone.” Meltzer-Cohen scoffed at the editorial. “They had to acquit,” she said, “there was absolutely no basis for the charges.”The lawyer does not see the recent wave of dismissals as an outright victory, but evidence of vast police misconduct and original prosecutorial overreach. “The way the cops use arrest as a form of crowd control dovetails so neatly with the way prosecutors drain us, even without getting any results. It's such a stupid war of attrition, with such pyrrhic victories on both ends,” she said. And for hundreds of arrestees, particularly the federal defendants, a reprieve is not on the near horizon.Freeman believes that in the many cases that remain, only 10 percent of defendants will seek to settle out of court, but that the majority of water protectors will want to fight their cases. “I will go to trial, I will not take a plea,” said a 21-year-old named White Wolf, who faces state charges of riot and trespass from an October 22 arrest. White Wolf was born and raised in Louisiana and comes from the Houma tribe. She went to Standing Rock “because she had to. For the next generation. I went because my ancestors would have done it,” she said via phone. She was among the injured of November 20, shot squarely in the body by a police concussion grenade—a traumatic event from which she said she is still “healing.”During the camp protests, the pipeline was dubbed “the black snake.” But for the Lakota, the black snake is not just one pipeline. It harkens back to a prophecy in which a great black snake would come to the Lakota lands and devastate the earth. According to the prophecy, it would be the youth who would rise up to slay the black snake—a detail not lost on the Standing Rock Sioux youth who were the first to set up camp against the pipeline in April 2016.“The black snake is greed and violence and oppression; we have to come together to fight more than just one pipeline to defeat the black snake,” said Rattler as we sat in the warm, wood-accented living room. Depending on one’s spiritual orientation, there could be either irony or destiny in the fact of Rattler’s position as a high profile defendant in the Standing Rock trials. He earned his name during his marine corps service in the early ‘90s. One night, he was sleeping outside at bootcamp in Pendleton, California—diamondback rattlesnake territory—when he felt a weight along the side of his body. He carefully felt along the mass. A six-foot long poisonous diamondback had wedged itself head down along the side of his sleeping bag. In one move, Rattler grabbed his service knife, grabbed the snake, and cut off its head. His lieutenant, emerging from a tent, watched on. He retells the story with gusto, a grin and dramatic hand gestures. “I was known for pissing off dangerous snakes,” he said. The name Rattler stuck, now an appropriate nom-de-guerre for a man who came to North Dakota to fight the black snake, and whose liberty is under threat because of it.Back in South Dakota, Rattler worked as a truck driver and a handyman, preferring to barter his trades and skills for items he needed to live, rather than money. Ceremony was already part of his life, as an entrusted Lakota pipe carrier—an honored role in ceremonial practice and tradition. He had first come to Standing Rock to deliver donated supplies from Pine Ridge in Betty Boop (his truck, for which he uses bio-fuel whenever possible). He made three return trips until one event in September prompted him to stay for good. “The dog attacks,” he said. In early September, protesters claimed that private DAPL security guards released attack dogs and sprayed mace on protesters.

"Seven young horse riders, involved in the clash between law enforcement and the “water protectors”, stated that they and their horses had been shot at in very close range with either bean bag guns or rubber bullets.  One rider explained he was shot three times with a bean bag and when his horse was shot he was knocked off his horse.  They were situated between protestors and police officers to protect those who were praying.  All the riders were arrested and their property as well as their horses and riding gear confiscated.  Three of the horses, including gear, have not yet been returned.  One elder woman stated that she was holding her sacred bundle skyward in prayer and was suddenly forced to the ground, crying out as she watched her sacred bundle fall to the ground. Those arrested were strip searched, many of them women who described this as humiliating in the extreme.  Those arrested and detained were physically marked with numbers on their arms which they describe as being akin to the branding of Jewish persons in Nazi Germany.  Many described how they were denied food and proper medical attention, including several who are diabetic.  They were placed in detention in what they described to me as “dog kennels” or cages located inside the garage of the Morton County jail on a bare concrete floor.  These “temporary holding cells” were said to hold up to 25 persons each.  Despite the cold concrete flooring neither cots nor blankets were provided.  After being processed at this site many were then sent to other prisons, some over 4 hours away, for further processing.Those arrested were not told why they were being arrested nor the charges they would face.  They only learned of the charges after they were arraigned and released.  All individuals arrested were charged with either misdemeanor and/or felony offences including maintaining a public nuisance; trespass on the private property of the pipeline builder; engaging in a riot; criminal conspiracy; and endangerment by fire.  Upon release, with bond payments in the form of cash as high as $1,500.00, many were left on their own to return to their respective camps.  Of course, many do not have such cash on hand.  Fortunately, many such costs have been paid through a fund set by the Standing Rock Sioux legal team for this purpose.There is clearly high tension and palpable anger in the main camp and with the leadership because of the conduct of the arrests and the subsequent jailing.  Many, including Indigenous spiritual leaders, described to me the extensive psychological trauma experienced by those who were praying and singing and those in a sweat lodge located at the site.  Legal counsel and human rights observers are documenting, through their interviews with the arrested protestors, the type, level and proportionality of response by law enforcement officers.  As well as journalists and many on site have been developing extensive photo and video records.Regarding the many stories of violation of civil and political rights, the arrest and criminalization of the over 141 individuals engaged in the protest of the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline raise serious human rights issues.  I expect the very significant and numerous details surrounding these matters will form a significant component in both the prosecution and defense of those charged.  I understand these cases will be before the courts as early as mid-November and early December 2016.The alarming acts that criminalize Indigenous peoples in their attempts to safeguard their human rights and fundamental freedoms that is unfolding in North Dakota should prompt the United States government into action.  Indeed, this is one of the most alarming facts about the situation in North Dakota:  the total lack of presence by the United States government. Insecurity intensifiesAs noted above, the senior law enforcement officials that I met with were directly involved in the planning and execution of the arrests of protestors at the north camp on October 27th.  The incident commander advised that Americans have the right to protest but overall their role was to ",X
".  They stated that they originally intended to move in on Wednesday, but they delayed until Thursday to give protestors another day to move from the north camp.Their narrative about the events of the day is decidedly different from that of many others.  They stated that they had been dealing with numerous individuals from the camps for the past 3 months and had a variety of minor and ongoing confrontations with various protestors, including some that they described as ",
 and further stated that no one should ,
".They stated that there has been a total of some 412 arrests, 9% of whom were from Standing Rock, including Standing Rock Sioux Tribal Chairman Dave Archambault.  They spoke about their well-developed and executed plans in dealing with those protestors who were blocking a public road and/or trespassing on private property, without any serious incidents or deaths. They stated that their plan included a ",
 and that they had ,
" slowly.  They indicated that their specific action on October 27th was triggered by purported unauthorized obstruction of a public highway and of criminal trespass onto private property -- that of the pipeline company – by protesters. Per these officers, the protestors were told to leave the obstruction on the highway and to end their trespass onto private property.  Those who left were not arrested. Those who remained were arrested and transferred to the Morton County jail.  As the 42 beds in the jail were in use, the arrested protestors were lodged in ",
" recently built by a fencing company.  I was further told that those arrested were treated with respect, fed, clothed and their medical needs attended to.  Law enforcement officials denied allegations of human rights violations or abuses.Regardless, this incident caused an immediate and dramatic increase in tension and a new level of state betrayal and rising hostilities towards law enforcement officials.  It is my hope that those who have shown restraint and a modicum of respect for others continue to deal fairly and honorably with the Standing Rock Sioux tribal members and their political leadership.  It must be understood that merely sending in police and security officials is absolutely no way to address the comprehensive and significant concerns raised by the Standing Rock Sioux. In summary, this is understandably very complex with numerous legal and political matters, with two primary but very different narratives.  However I cannot, nor will I, minimize or disregard in any the very compelling stories of those leaders, elders, cultural and spiritual leaders, supporters from many other Indigenous Nations -the ",
