00:01
deep down way on down there is something
00:05
stirring something very very valuable it
00:08
is a race to the bottom to the bottom of
00:11
the oceans and it is deep sea mighty as
00:31
far down as five thousand meters maybe
00:34
more lie a host of materials critical
00:36
for modern society from smartphones to
00:38
electric cars to green energy
00:40
how can it be mined without ruining
00:43
another beautiful so far relatively
00:46
untouched invaluable part of our planet
00:55
it's been called the new Gold Rush
00:57
the race is on to mine the precious
00:59
minerals buried in the seabed China
01:02
hopes to play a leading role in the
01:04
drive to extract the metals from the
01:06
ocean floor so far
01:08
China has four of the 29 deep sea
01:10
exploration contracts issued by the
01:12
International seabed authority the most
01:14
of any country one of the contracts
01:17
allocates a surface area of nearly 73
01:19
thousand square kilometres of the
01:21
Clarion Clipperton fracture zone in the
01:23
Pacific Ocean the International seabed
01:26
authority is still writing the
01:28
regulations but says a big part of its
01:30
mandate aims to minimize environmental
01:32
harm
01:33
but research scientists at the
01:35
University of Exeter are concerned that
01:37
once the first commercial contract for
01:39
mining is issued there will be no going
01:42
back and there's still not enough
01:44
research to confirm just what damage
01:47
will be done to the environment and I'm
01:53
very pleased to say they're joining us
01:55
from Washington DC we have called mutant
01:57
project director of seabed mining
01:59
project at the Pew Charitable Trusts we
02:02
cross to Kingston in Jamaica then and to
02:04
Michael lodge secretary general of the
02:06
International seabed authority while
02:09
with me at the round table we have Regan
02:11
Grenon research assistant and UK seabed
02:13
resources who studies the biodiversity
02:15
of the ocean floor and Charlotte middle
02:18
Hearst a contributing editor and China
02:19
dialogue focusing on China's growing
02:21
interest in deep-sea mining and indeed
02:24
Charlotte everybody's the continued
02:27
interest in deep-sea mining because it's
02:28
not China but China are taking a very
02:31
firm hold on it at the moment
02:32
by no means just China but China is
02:35
making a play for power in this
02:38
developing sector China now owns the
02:41
greatest number of licenses can
02:44
contracts to start mining the seabed
02:49
particularly in the Clarion clipton zone
02:52
and we shall refer to that in future as
02:54
the czz okay because that's quite well
02:57
known and everybody here is aware of it
02:59
just south of Hawaii right that's right
03:02
in the Pacific and at the same time
03:05
China is conscious that it needs to
03:07
develop this sector and with an
03:10
environmental conscience and it's
03:12
enshrined a commitment to safeguard the
03:15
environment and mitigate any harm that
03:19
is caused through mining in law that it
03:23
created in 2016 and it's also the
03:27
commitment in its five-year plan on
03:30
seabed mining which stretches from 2016
03:32
to 2021 but Connor I want to come to you
03:36
first of all we need what is on the
03:38
ocean floor I say we need but at the
03:40
moment there's no sign of that desire
03:43
diminishing we need it for smartphones
03:46
for new technology
03:47
green energy because there are so many
03:49
different products down there that are
03:50
vital at the moment it has to be
03:53
controlled doesn't it
03:55
sure of course it does like any
03:58
exploitative industry it has to be
04:00
regulated that's why Michael is here
04:02
this morning and is it being regulated
04:04
before I ask Michael what he does in his
04:06
organization do you think enough is
04:07
being done well I think the interesting
04:11
part about this work is that it's the
04:14
first opportunity in history to write a
04:17
rule book to govern an industry before
04:20
it begins so there is no deep-sea mining
04:23
at present and Michael runs the
04:26
organization at which discussions
04:28
debates take place which will inform the
04:32
character of those of those regular when
04:34
we talk about the fact that China's
04:35
putting up deposits already it's not
04:37
doing it in a deep-sea area it's doing
04:39
it in what coastal waters China is is
04:43
conducting operations in coastal waters
04:45
but they are exploratory and in the deep
04:48
sea they are taking samples of the
04:51
bottom no one is in exploitation phase
04:54
all those contracts are exploratory
04:58
contracts ok Michael do you are you
05:01
meeting any resistance in the kind of
05:02
work you're trying to do from people who
05:04
have what you might call their own
05:06
national interests at heart well I think
05:10
it's important to mention first as there
05:14
is no mining or harvesting taking place
05:18
at the moment at a commercial scale but
05:21
there's still challenges before it
05:24
begins
05:24
and what we're engaged in the boat is
05:27
exploration in fact there's nothing
05:29
really new in this we've been exploring
05:31
the deep ocean for minerals since the
05:34
1960's not only that we discovered that
05:37
we could actually do it as long ago as
05:39
the 1970s that the problem at the time
05:42
was that it was way too expensive the
05:44
harvest minerals from 5000 meters deep
05:47
and five or six days away from land
05:49
which is where the CCC is and also the
05:54
world had not yet woken up to the fact
05:56
that continuing to rely on coal and
05:59
other fossil
06:00
our engine needs was not going to be
06:02
sustained but are we just going to be
06:04
raping another part of our beautiful
06:06
planet to satisfy man's insatiable needs
06:09
well we have to wean ourselves off
06:11
fossil fuels and this is going to
06:13
require massive quantities of new
06:14
minerals especially the minerals that we
06:17
need for batteries
06:18
such as nickel copper and cobalt which
06:20
happened to be the minerals that are
06:22
found in rich concentrations on the
06:25
ocean floor for example the World Bank
06:28
estimates that to get to close loop
06:31
economy at some stage in the future
06:32
we'll need 40 times the total supply of
06:35
minerals that we have today and that's
06:38
why we see increased interest increased
06:41
investment in deep-sea exploration and
06:44
that includes us research of the sort
06:47
that adrenaline is doing on the
06:49
ecological aspects and other potential
06:51
environmental impacts of what I want to
06:55
push on it is the fact that yeah you say
06:57
it's great to have this people are
06:58
looking for it where we're going to need
07:00
these materials if we're gonna win
07:02
ourselves off fossil fuels but there is
07:04
a danger that you are going to allow a
07:07
beautiful natural resource to be
07:09
pillaged and for it not to be able to
07:12
recover how do you stop that happening
07:14
well nobody's talking about energy
07:16
first of all we have the fact that this
07:19
activity is very highly regulated we
07:23
have the International seabed authority
07:24
and I really can't emphasize this enough
07:26
actually contrary to popular perception
07:30
in some places deep ocean which actually
07:34
covers 54 percent or so of the planet's
07:37
surface is not an unregulated space at
07:40
all in fact it's the only example that
07:42
we have of a space and a resource that
07:45
is internationally managed for the
07:48
benefit of all humanity to put it
07:51
another way
07:52
without why I say we would have a
07:54
free-for-all where anybody could access
07:56
deep sea minerals without any kind of
07:58
regulation at all and then you may well
08:00
result in pillaging the resource sorry I
08:05
will come back to you Michael but I just
08:07
want to ask Regan a couple of questions
08:08
because you were out there yeah looking
08:10
at pictures beamed out from the the
08:13
bad floor for that one of the deepest
08:16
parts of the oceans and you saw
08:18
extraordinary things are you worried at
08:21
all cause you're working for the seabed
08:22
authority is that correct
08:24
yes and I'm working at the Natural
08:26
History but you're also part of a
08:29
Lockheed Martin project and there they
08:31
are a military we're largely known for
08:34
their military capabilities and
08:36
production are you worried at all about
08:38
what might happen and I think if you
08:41
actually just take a step back and think
08:42
that scientists like myself are actually
08:45
getting the opportunity to be able to
08:47
study this habitat before regulation is
08:49
put in place before and before mining
08:52
even occurs there's a real what makes it
08:53
really unique in terms of exploitative
08:57
industries in the past and really makes
08:59
it unique point in history so I think
09:00
it's a huge positive that scientists
09:02
like myself are actually being included
09:04
in it and that there is an emphasis and
09:06
push towards understanding these
09:07
ecosystems before any of this is allowed
09:09
to take place and what do you saw just
09:12
amazed you didn't it yeah so it read a
09:15
really are really incredible
09:16
environments we still know very little
09:18
about the deep sea and there's
09:20
incredible animals from really brightly
09:22
colored sea cucumbers with big tails or
09:24
kind of like bat wings for swimming two
09:26
sponges made of glass they're glass and
09:28
the skeleton they look like kind of
09:29
flowers and a lot of these they're not
09:31
an octopus that had ears like an
09:33
elephant yeah that too all sorts of
09:35
weird and wonderful kind of creatures as
09:36
well and a lot of them require the hard
09:40
surface to be mined for example these
09:42
polymetallic nodules that are the mining
09:43
interest in this area some of them
09:45
require them to grow on so for example
09:47
corals and sponges they need that hard
09:49
surface to grow on yeah and it can
09:51
easily be spoiled they say I was gonna
09:52
just quite an example here 1989 the Peru
09:54
basin they put down this massive what
09:57
was 8 meter by 8 meter I think wow if
10:00
you like to see what might happen
10:01
it was scraped across the ocean floor
10:03
backwards and forwards and they went
10:05
back 26 years later to see what might
10:08
have recovered and the answer was
10:10
nothing it was exactly as it was yeah so
10:13
these are really really kind of
10:15
low-energy cold slow environments I
10:17
think some of the oldest animals on the
10:19
planet have been found in the deep sea I
10:21
think there was a coral it's discovered
10:22
recently that was over 4,000 years old
10:24
they're really slow environments so
10:26
they're
10:27
recked impact will likely result in
10:29
biodiversity loss that will be very
10:30
difficult to recover from but we really
10:32
don't understand as any of the wider
10:33
impacts as well some outside the area of
10:36
mining itself how will this affect the
10:40
ecosystem at large how will this feed
10:41
back into the oceans we think that the
10:43
deep sea could play a big role in terms
10:45
of carbon storage heat sequestration so
10:48
there could be further wider impacts
10:49
that actually feed more directly back
10:51
into human society other than just the
10:53
loss do you believe that massive
10:55
corporations who are putting millions
10:57
and millions of dollars into this and
10:58
Lockheed Martin as as I mentioned has
11:00
been looking into this since the late
11:02
1970s do you believe they have out true
11:05
istic ambitions here and I think it's
11:10
difficult to say and it's not really
11:11
really in my position to say but I think
11:13
the fact that there is such funding for
11:16
the science and funding to understand
11:18
this and this emphasis and push towards
11:20
all stakeholders to work together on
11:22
this I think is a huge positive and I
11:25
think we have to kind of look at that
11:26
aspect so in terms of the motivations
11:29
it's difficult to say but the fact that
11:30
the outcome is currently a positive I
11:34
think that's it Connor Michael I'll come
11:35
to you in just a moment to ask for your
11:36
thoughts on that but Charlotte there is
11:38
not much evidence in the history of
11:40
industrialized mankind of corporations
11:43
taking a preemptive strike at doing what
11:48
they do for the best of intentions
11:49
rather than for their own selfish
11:51
reasons
11:52
well quite and I think it would be naive
11:54
to assume that fit motive is coming
11:58
after altruism when looking at the
12:01
reasons why companies are undertaking
12:03
these ventures and that's not to say
12:06
that there aren't wider benefits for
12:08
Humanity to come out of these research
12:11
and exploration trips but I think yeah
12:14
it to assume that they're altruistic is
12:17
going a bit far so so Michael it's your
12:19
job as the the underwater policeman of
12:22
the world if I could be so flippant to
12:25
make sure that the floor isn't raped
12:29
that instances on a grander scale to the
12:32
one I've just described where the seabed
12:33
didn't recover even in a quarter of a
12:36
century are not allowed to happen how do
12:38
you do that
12:40
well correct and that's forget about
12:42
altruism I don't think that's got
12:44
anything to do with it the reason that
12:46
these companies and countries are
12:49
carrying out this important scientific
12:51
work is because we the is a tell them
12:54
that they must do it it's a requirement
12:57
and when I say the is a you must bear in
13:00
mind that the ISA is actually 168 member
13:04
states acting together by consensus and
13:08
protecting these important ecosystems is
13:11
really a core part of our mandate and
13:13
that's why we require even at the
13:15
exploration phase that the contractors
13:18
are required to carry out these detailed
13:20
environmental studies collecting
13:23
environmental data and pass it to the
13:25
ICA where we make it publicly available
13:27
to everybody in the world and as you can
13:30
see from Myers talking to Drennen we use
13:33
or we require contractors to use the
13:36
best available scientific evidence which
13:38
is why some of the very best scientific
13:41
institutions in the world such as the
13:43
Natural History Museum are carrying out
13:46
this work on behalf of contractors
13:47
because of the requirement under mental
13:50
part of our con is is it naive of me to
13:53
wonder whether in fact there's a better
13:55
way of doing this and that is to say
13:57
actually we you've got to find different
14:00
ways of providing the materials you need
14:03
for green energy tech etc etc military
14:07
operators rather than going down to the
14:09
seafloor and digging it up from there
14:11
you've got to find another way of doing
14:13
this because we cannot allow such a
14:15
wonderful resource to potentially be
14:17
ruined well you know that would be ideal
14:22
look all mining is destructive whether
14:27
you conducted on land or whether you're
14:28
conducted on the bottom of the sea
14:30
you will lose ecosystem values the
14:34
question is how to minimize that can on
14:37
land and on sea one way of trying to
14:43
assure some continuity of life of the
14:47
rich life the Jenners been describing is
14:50
the establishment of large no mining
14:53
zones
14:54
adjacent to the ones that you license
14:57
the other obviously would be more public
15:01
policy on recycling the materials we
15:04
have but that World Bank report that
15:07
Michael cited does show pretty clearly
15:10
that there will be a skyrocketing demand
15:14
for those minerals and that will get
15:17
them one way or another and it's up to
15:20
it's up to all of us to see if we can
15:24
design a system that minimizes harm
15:28
there's a scientist Regan I mean when
15:31
you look at what was was down there this
15:33
must be your big concern isn't it that
15:35
no matter what is done at corn is saying
15:38
it is destructive yes and I think that's
15:43
just a fact as we can't it's still
15:46
mining on large scale ills still away
15:48
away so I think it's more and I my
15:52
motivation is currently to whatever the
15:54
outcome to produce the best science so
15:56
that we can understand and mitigate as
15:58
much as we can
16:02
how far have you got so far what are
16:05
your best ideas on how to limit the
16:07
damage and well we're still just to kind
16:10
of give an idea of this kind of the
16:12
scope of understanding these ecosystems
16:14
I'm currently working on samples that
16:16
were collected in 2013 2015 on just a
16:20
baseline understanding of the
16:21
biodiversity there so going through
16:23
describing species hundreds of new
16:26
species are being described and almost
16:28
all the stuff we bring back as new
16:29
designs and I'm still working on those
16:31
samples and we still haven't got to it
16:32
so I think it's a big job and I think
16:35
it's I think it's also an important part
16:37
of the science is actually to be able to
16:39
inform the public and inform societies
16:41
the hosts they know what sake do you
16:43
think it's true I may have got this
16:45
wrong but I think I don't think I have
16:47
that there are more undiscovered species
16:49
in the deep depths of the ocean and
16:51
those we have already found on the
16:54
surface of our planet well I wouldn't be
16:56
surprised at all just from what I do too
16:58
on a day-to-day basis just looking
17:01
through these samples from teeny tiny
17:03
little kind of worms all the way up to
17:04
more bigger recognisable things like
17:06
starfish
17:07
I think these areas are so there's kind
17:09
of a last frontier on earth because
17:11
they're so unexplored and I think from a
17:13
basic kind of human curiosity and
17:15
exploration oh that's quite exciting
17:17
it's kind of like getting to go to the
17:19
Amazon first you know and so I think
17:23
yeah that could definitely so I think
17:25
that's why it's really important to do
17:27
the best quality science we can to be
17:28
able to inform the technology
17:30
regulations society as well I think it's
17:33
ultimately a societal decision too it's
17:35
not just the decision of state of
17:38
individual stakeholders if only we could
17:40
all sit down and agree that it is the
17:41
right thing to do and then do it it
17:44
would be a much better work but
17:46
Charlotte is this true as well that the
17:49
minerals that are down there it could
17:50
also hold great medicinal value in terms
17:54
of sort of finding cures for cancer or
17:56
furthering the research into antibiotics
17:58
etc etc it could be a say but we have to
18:02
go there yes absolutely the world is
18:04
currently running out of antibiotics
18:07
that work there's a big issue around
18:10
aunty microbial resistance we need to
18:13
find new antibiotics and scientists
18:17
believe that some of these many of these
18:19
can be found on the ocean floor and so
18:22
there's that interest too but and I
18:24
wanted to pick up on a point from Kahn
18:26
actually which was about how to protect
18:29
the complex biodiversity that we're
18:32
talking about and you know that was the
18:35
point you made about declaring no mining
18:37
zones and I think that's critical and I
18:41
think something we've not addressed yet
18:43
is the relationship China and other
18:46
countries have with states in the
18:49
Pacific whose national interests are
18:51
being affected by this this is about
18:53
geopolitics as well as environmental
18:56
protection this is an about China making
18:59
deals drawing up contracts with
19:02
countries like Fiji Papua New Guinea the
19:04
Marshall Islands and where they are
19:07
including access to the seabed or
19:10
financing seabed mining these are
19:13
wealthy countries who might welcome the
19:15
investment that they get from signing
19:16
these
19:18
that's another worry though isn't it
19:19
Khan that we could actually sort of
19:21
start to sort of see people down there
19:23
exploiting it and they've if you've got
19:25
the money even as Michael says it's a
19:27
it's a financial barrier to entry if
19:29
once you capture what you need down
19:32
there then you become a very very
19:34
important player in the world
19:36
geopolitically possibly I think you
19:41
could draw an analogy to the drilling
19:45
and selling oil there will be no doubt I
19:49
think that any nation that controls a
19:54
large measure of the supply of seabed
19:57
minerals will be a nation with resources
20:00
but that's pretty far gap from where we
20:03
are now this is a this is an embryonic
20:06
industry it's not even an infant
20:08
industry and it will not approach
20:12
anything like terrestrial levels of
20:14
production Oh four decades on decades so
20:18
it's great are here to imagine yeah I
20:20
didn't mean to stop it Carol you know
20:23
well it's it's fun to imagine you know
20:26
lots of bipeds living in wonderful domes
20:29
and and colourful fishes swim by and
20:33
they irrigate our gardens but I think
20:36
life is a little more prosaic and the
20:39
future won't be quite so comic boogie
20:41
okay Michael 2020 I think the new rules
20:44
under the United Nations Convention on
20:46
the laws of the sea what you're working
20:47
on should come in into force you're
20:49
happy with where you are right now
20:50
twelve months or whatever away yes very
20:54
well thirty-six member states the next
21:01
meeting takes place in Kingston in a few
21:04
weeks time it will be streamed online
21:06
for the whole world to watch if they
21:08
wish to do so and I hope that we can
21:11
make very good parents at the next
21:13
meeting indication so far okay will it
21:17
become the financial war and possibly a
21:19
sort of a resources war at some point in
21:22
the future do you think so I'm going to
21:23
come back to you in a moment Reagan to
21:24
end the program for me I think it's are
21:29
including some kind of
21:31
to speculate to fire insect could result
21:34
in conflict at this stage I think is a
21:37
bit of a physical conflict I mean some
21:42
confrontation if you like yes I think
21:44
whoever holds the key to these precious
21:47
resources will be in a position of real
21:50
power and will be able to exert that
21:52
politically and economically around the
21:54
world as we've seen countries do not
21:58
least China with you know land-based
22:01
resources and minerals and and I think
22:04
this next few years will be really
22:07
critical in determining who has the
22:10
power in the future and and how that's
22:13
used because this is the the chance we
22:16
have the window of opportunity to create
22:18
some robust regulation and ensure we
22:22
have a framework the ISA has a framework
22:25
that's fit for purpose and the high seas
22:27
alliance and other NGOs are calling for
22:29
greater transparency and in terms of the
22:33
is A's institutional making meetings
22:37
coming up so I'm sure that will be our
22:39
least discussed there I mean I just love
22:41
pictures like this Regan I mean what is
22:44
down there it is extraordinary I so
22:45
wanted to go down in in a deep capsule
22:48
let me ask you this as a scientist as a
22:51
lover of what is down there what will we
22:54
lose if we mess this up I think the main
22:58
point of speak we don't fully know what
23:00
we will lose because we still understand
23:02
it fully understand it so we kind of we
23:03
can't know what will be impacted if we
23:06
don't know what is there to be impacted
23:07
in the first place and obviously they're
23:09
incredibly special environments and I
23:11
think just emphasizing the need to fully
23:14
understand them also I think being able
23:17
to improve the kind of outreach point of
23:20
view from a scientists perspective get
23:22
the public engaged get the public kind
23:24
of invested and knowledgeable about the
23:26
deep sea so they can be informed and
23:28
have a stake in these decisions in the
23:29
future as well and I think some so for
23:32
example you said you wanted to look at
23:33
the deep sea a lot of deep-sea research
23:36
expeditions they livestream their their
23:40
kind of underwater robots essentially
23:42
that's going on the Schmidt ocean
23:44
Institute is currently live-streaming
23:46
their deep-sea diving in Costa Rica and
23:48
anyone can just Google that Google that
23:50
and watch the livestream here the
23:52
science is talking and it's like being
23:53
in the room on the ships I think but
23:55
there is always this danger a bit like
23:57
sort of when people went to the
24:00
continent what is now the continents the
24:01
United States of America and brought
24:03
their diseases with them that they could
24:05
even though perhaps they weren't
24:07
necessarily wanting to do harm that they
24:09
would just bring it with them and it
24:10
inevitably happened and that of course
24:12
is the big danger here we don't know
24:14
what yeah down there we don't know how
24:15
sensitive it is and we don't know how to
24:17
behave do you think enough is being done
24:19
and I think there's always room to
24:22
improve and I think just putting a
24:24
really strong emphasis on making
24:26
standardized widespread kind of
24:28
environmental regulation but I think
24:31
again what makes this unique is that
24:34
obviously humanity doesn't have a good
24:35
track record in terms of exploitation
24:37
but I think what makes us unique is that
24:40
there are these steps being made at the
24:41
very first stage the fact that
24:42
scientists are being involved from the
24:44
very start I think that's a huge
24:45
positive to take one massive
24:47
responsibility Michael we at the moment
24:58
we have approved 29 contracts for
25:00
exploration involved in 22 different
25:02
countries and that covers about 0.7% of
25:07
the whole of the deep seabed area which
25:10
is about less than half a percent of the
25:13
world's oceans so we're actually talking
25:15
about very small parts here and by the
25:18
way I do fully agree with the point
25:20
that's made by cohn earlier that we need
25:23
large no mining areas that will be
25:26
satisfied and preserved this is a
25:28
fundamental part of our work to design
25:30
and these areas are the most responsible
25:33
and environmentally accessible way thank
25:35
you thank you very much indeed so
25:36
perhaps the final frontier isn't
25:39
somewhere out there it is somewhere down
25:41
there Conn Michael thank you very much
25:43
indeed Charlotte Regan thank you for
25:45
coming on thank you for watching we've
25:47
been talking about what lies beneath
25:49
that's always the case with round table
25:51
I hope see you next time bye bye
25:54
