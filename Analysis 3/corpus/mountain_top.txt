Marsh Fork Mining Protests
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBhvFWRLiOs
come on in' is our way of life I've got
00:48
four grandkids that goes to this school
00:50
my kids went through this school my
00:53
husband and his parents went through
00:55
these schools none of us are sick and if
00:59
you choose to live in West Virginia this
01:02
is this is the best paying job there is
01:06
what happens if mountaintop removal goes
01:09
away what happens to you and your family
01:29
let things walk in our shoes for a while
01:32
and then you know let's see what they
01:35
had to say I've come from a long line of
01:38
coal miners and my father was born in
01:42
1915 he was an underground miner he
01:45
didn't think MTR was mining he thought
01:48
it was heavy equipment used you know I
01:51
know people are worried about their jobs
01:53
but reclaiming the mountains that's
01:57
already been destroyed it's going to
01:59
take years they're not going to lose
02:01
their jobs
02:02
I have jobs there for a long time we
02:05
still have plenty of underground mines
02:07
and men haven't been utilized in that
02:11
function you know Cole isn't going
02:15
anywhere we're going to have coal but
02:18
there are alternative functions to use
02:20
with it that make it a sustainable
02:23
Society so issues like this it's not a
02:28
good thing you know I think that the
02:31
miners are saying they're worried about
02:32
their jobs it seems like they're not
02:36
taking in the information that's being
02:38
provided trying to tell our side of the
02:42
story in our study the story doesn't get
02:45
told often enough the media doesn't seem
02:50
like it wants to tell the truth about
02:53
our side
02:54
it's always the environment extremists
02:57
side of the story
02:58
well our side of the story is the coal
03:03
mining coal industry provides jobs and
03:07
if mountaintop mining is done right
03:10
which it is the reclaim we do a good job
03:15
want to reclaim we replant trees the
03:19
streams are taken care of it's not we're
03:24
not about raping the mountains we're
03:26
just up here trying to make a living for
03:28
families do you think that I mean they
03:31
don't they don't have a point and
03:33
and they aren't seeing you guys decided
03:35
to stop well a lot of them don't know
03:37
our side of the story
03:38
they they're uneducated about it all
03:41
they see is the pictures on TV a strip
03:45
job does look bad but it don't look any
03:47
worse than a road construction job they
03:49
take the tops of mountains off the road
03:51
construction and they reclaim it we
03:53
reclaim it to you it's not just a local
03:56
issue it reverberates throughout the
03:59
whole country and I think most of the
04:00
people that I know don't even know that
04:02
we are doing this don't know also that
04:05
we have solutions available to us now
04:08
that is in finite renewable regenerative
04:11
energy that doesn't cause poisoned
04:16
rivers and decorated degraded
04:21
environments loss of ecosystems so I'm
04:26
here to you know sort of stand in
04:28
solidarity with those who are fighting
04:51
walking for that same reason today and
04:55
here's my final word I promise to you
04:57
today in the Gospel of Matthew in the
05:00
17th chapter it says the thing has a
05:03
faith of a mustard seed a tiny mother
05:14
Queen absolutely honored to be standing
05:26
here today with y'all take off this day
05:29
of action to be standing longer people
05:31
in mountaintop removal this year and
05:34
take back at Elisha their clean
05:36
renewable energy users of everything for
05:39
everyone and don't look at this school
05:41
is to look at everything that is wrong
05:55
for me to go home is walking distance
06:00
it's a failure to communicate by
06:12
hecklers by politicians by whole
06:15
influence politicians by sport and we
06:21
just had a threat of violence over here
06:25
the industry deals with the sense this
06:29
is how the industry deals with social
06:32
stand up for the rights to protester
06:35
holy we are busy with pets are home to
06:38
protect our air for capture wanted to
06:41
drive deputies children who go to school
06:45
Florida guard for the toxic sludge
06:48
banner my concern is that there's no
06:51
need there's no need to destroy our
06:55
planet in order to power up our future
07:02
when I first learned about mountaintop
07:04
was over life my job as a floor and I
07:07
couldn't believe that in America we
07:09
actually blow up our mountains and push
07:11
it into the rivers of the valleys below
07:13
it's too much excuse me illegals are
07:16
plans on the workplaces advise jobs that
07:19
don't bill cause asthma possible as now
07:41
I'm Charlie Brown suppose I just website
07:45
incomparably there here protesting
07:47
against us they need to go back to where
07:50
they came from if they're for us that's
07:52
good
07:53
they're against us get out of the state
07:55
I do live here yeah but the problem is
07:58
there are people that don't live here
08:00
that are here because the cold that's
08:01
mind here is mined out of state and it's
08:04
being burned in Para place that's making
08:05
third kids sick so this is America
08:08
and the cold that's being shipped out of
08:10
here opens up the fact that people
08:12
people from other places that are being
08:15
poisoned can come here and protest this
08:16
this this is everybody's mountains this
08:18
is everybody's air this is everybody's
08:19
water just doesn't belong to people that
08:22
live here they're supposed to Mars on
08:24
the bridge that want a guard to come
08:26
over and give us demands we're blocking
08:29
the bridge I mean we're all sticking
08:33
together
09:48
this is your last chance to get up
10:00
your mistress will get up everybody says
10:04
James is about to get a statement you
10:06
want to
10:12
our sacred duty to resist
10:28
oh and the
10:31
first we believe that no child's health
10:35
and safety are expendable
10:37
before the Expediency of a dirty energy
10:40
source
10:58
first of all to bring attention to the
11:00
devastation devastating effects of
11:03
mountaintop removal and to make a call
11:06
for clean renewable infinite energy
11:10
resources which we have
11:36
Oh
12:38
trying to draw attention for the sake of
12:40
young people our children and
12:42
grandchildren trying to draw attention
12:44
of Washington to a problem that they're
12:46
continuing to ignore and what's your
12:48
personal essay answer well I think it's
12:54
worth it yes it's not only something we
12:58
should do it's a responsibility to draw
13:00
attention to the matter and just write
13:02
to get Washington to pay attention they
13:04
can't compromise the way offices they've
13:07
got to realize they've got to phase out
13:09
coal emissions and you have to start
13:11
with mountaintop removal because of all
13:12
the other things that it does
13:14
mountaintop removal provides only 7% of
13:17
our coal we could stop it right now what
13:24
do you think is it worth it is this
13:26
worth it yeah push it's present where is
13:28
it for us all our grandchildren and our
13:30
children we've got to stop burning coal
13:35
in this country and we've got to give
13:36
people other good jobs to do and there's
13:39
plenty of jobs that need to be done
13:40
we've got to build a whole new energy
13:42
infrastructure for this country and if
13:43
we don't we're going to have a climate
13:46
chaos and our kids are going to not
13:47
thank us for that and what do you say to
13:49
the people who say it's none of your
13:50
business don't tell West Virginia tell
13:51
it well my mother was born in about two
13:54
miles from here in Clay County but I
13:56
think it's all of our business anyway
13:58
because my children are going to use
14:00
breathe the same air that these people
14:13
Marsh Fork elementary school has become
14:16
a symbol in the long fought battle of a
14:18
mountaintop removal mining protestors
14:21
point to the school as an example of
14:23
abuse the mining inflicts on local
14:25
communities they say the school's
14:27
proximity to coal operations and the
14:29
dust and chemicals associated with them
14:32
put children at risk state officials say
14:35
the school is safe meanwhile Massey
14:37
Energy subsidiary goals coal company is
14:40
battling state environmental regulators
14:42
to put a second coal silo near the
14:44
school the details are new but they fit
14:47
into a larger history of the politics
14:49
between industry local communities and
14:52
government in the coal fields up until
14:55
the 1960s late 1960s cooperations large
15:01
business operations had little
15:05
accountability and what their
15:08
environmental choices to some degree the
15:12
way they treated workers at least until
15:13
the UMW came along but by the 1960s that
15:18
changed dramatically locals began to
15:22
organize people throughout Appalachia
15:25
realized they had a common interest not
15:27
only an environment but in their
15:31
everyday lives their quality of life the
15:38
role of outsiders fuels some of the
15:41
emotion of a marsh Fork elementary
15:42
school some residents near the school
15:45
say protesters from outside the
15:47
community aren't welcome on the protest
15:50
and with the school and stuff I think
15:51
it's crazy I mean the protestors that
15:53
are in here they don't live here so they
15:55
really don't know what's going on
15:58
they're not from here they come in
16:00
they're staying in people's houses
16:03
written them out they do community work
16:05
which they don't bother me either you
16:07
know they're trying to make their living
16:09
just as well I know most of my mat is
16:12
going to college and it's just a summer
16:14
thing house outside interests played
16:16
what role they played in
16:18
test historically on collisions well
16:21
it's that complaint about outsiders is
16:25
common if one looks at the civil rights
16:27
movement in the South one of the early
16:30
complaints when that was taking place
16:31
was that where there would be no
16:33
problems among blacks in the south if it
16:36
wasn't for college students from the
16:38
north coming in and stirring these
16:39
things up but the spark where these
16:42
things begin is in that local community
16:45
and in Appalachian and in particular in
16:50
areas such as this usually there's not
16:52
that large of a population in in these
16:55
areas and they need outside help at
16:58
organizing and and strengthening their
17:00
voice yes we have had a lot of outside
17:03
or I guess you could call outside people
17:06
coming in to help us with that a few
17:10
members of the community fighting
17:12
government and coal company over an
17:15
issue such as the safety of their
17:17
children you can't do it alone and I
17:19
thank God for them coming in and helping
17:22
us with that more power to them we need
17:26
somebody if they're Outsiders that's
17:31
good while locals are involved in the
17:35
protest many in the area around Marsh
17:37
work elementary school are reluctant to
17:39
address the issue several declined to
17:41
comment at all and even fewer agreed to
17:44
appear on video Raik says that fits into
17:46
the historical patterns during protests
17:50
the people who are going to take the
17:52
heat who may be ostracized by the
17:58
leadership in a given area are the folks
18:00
who live there and that's a that's
18:02
frightening that can be frightening
18:05
you may feel safe as long as you have a
18:07
large group of politically active but
18:10
you don't know what's going to happen
18:11
after they pull out and and that's not
18:15
uncommon for four years one did not dare
18:19
you even mentioned unionization because
18:25
they lose their job they lose their home
18:28
their company halt it's there is always
18:34
in someone's mind there is the idea that
18:36
well if I if I take part in this if I
18:40
protest what's happening and I try to
18:42
bring some change and it doesn't work we
18:46
lose then who's left hear me what is
18:57
left now near Marsh Ford elementary
18:59
school is a tumultuous debate about
19:01
loyalties and who belongs in the
19:03
community they have no right if they
19:06
don't want to be here and other people
19:07
don't want to be here move I mean to me
19:10
that's just the way I feel about it I
19:11
choose to live here but I do not choose
19:15
to have my grandchildren going into a
19:19
school that has the potential for danger
19:22
I see both um you know I agree with both
19:25
of them
19:26
I don't think they should have it so
19:28
close to the school maybe then again a
19:31
lot of the school fundings come from
19:35
Massie I know they've done lot down here
19:37
in white school with watch the pole in
19:39
the schools
19:40
lot of these protesters mild state and
19:43
all of them here in the state a lot of
19:46
them I agree with because their concern
19:49
for the kids and things and they are
19:51
really concerned about the dust problems
19:53
and thoughts and stuff like it I mean
19:55
I'm not from a seer against Massie I
19:57
know a lot of them that work there I
19:59
mean they're good people and I feel that
20:02
if they say it's safe it should be safe
20:04
because they have families you know kids
20:07
and stuff they're not going to go out
20:09
there and put their own children in
20:10
danger like you stop tearing down our
20:13
mountains Victor clean up our water that
20:17
could clean the air and get out near
20:21
Marsh Fork there is a sense of
20:23
resignation that this is just another
20:25
phase in a long line of conflicts I wish
20:28
to help get up get it over with
20:30
they're going to let them put it up or
20:32
not that way probably might stop but
20:35
then again what's that gets done over
20:37
with it'd be something else
20:39
for everybody to pick on do something
20:42
else about protesting about that whole
20:44
idea of of West Virginians that you
20:50
can't fight quote the big man is well
20:56
ingrained is well ingrained and they
20:58
don't think they're going to be heard
20:59
they don't think they think that if they
21:01
they don't do something drastic if we
21:04
don't protest in the capital
21:06
no one's going to hear us 60-70 huge
21:19
caravans of people driving to Charleston
21:21
to protest strip mine they knew it was
21:24
the only way their voice is going to be
21:26
heard again because the structure the if
21:29
the structure is not there for them to
21:32
get an immediate voice I look at this
21:35
way the protesters are doing a good
21:37
thing in a way but they're fighting a
21:40
losing battle I feel myself I feel like
21:43
they're just fighting a losing battle
21:44
because of the politicians and the big
21:49
coal companies and things they're going
21:51
to win hands down because the judges and
21:53
arbitrators are going to go their way
21:56
Ralph Jarrell is a retired coal miner he
21:59
worked for a number of companies
22:00
including Massey but he's cynical about
22:03
the future of his community because he
22:05
says so much has already been lost
22:07
they've got all this post they've got
22:10
all this posted as far as you want to go
22:13
it's all posted you can hear record
22:15
checks you go up here to employers guard
22:18
checks you go to hazy
22:19
there's guard shacks Montcoal mountain
22:21
or scarred shacks let's take the
22:23
mountain guard shacks so what's the man
22:25
do in this area and we're used to raise
22:29
and gardens farming's working in a coal
22:31
mines and Hatton and fishing that's our
22:34
life
22:35
professor rakes is also a former coal
22:37
miner from neighboring Fayette County so
22:40
you mind coal for 20 years before
22:43
shifting to history yes so how does that
22:46
that's just all of this strike you as
22:49
someone who's worked within the coal
22:51
industry and then going and studying
22:54
this academically has it changed the way
22:57
you think about and talk about coal oh
22:59
absolutely
23:01
when I worked particularly with Pittston
23:05
I tended to lean toward production
23:11
whatever given a situation I would
23:19
always think of production first I've
23:23
been guilty myself of stretching things
23:27
let's say it was sludge ponds with a
23:33
variety of environmental concerns
23:35
because I was concerned about production
23:37
but now I see it in a much larger
23:39
context I grew up hearing that you can't
23:45
trust coat the coal companies but I got
23:49
a mixed message the cooperation gives us
23:54
our livelihood and we need to work hard
23:58
for them
24:00
but you can't trust them and it becomes
24:04
acculturating so I see it on much larger
24:07
scale
24:53
there's
24:56
is now
25:07
are you
25:13
we say
25:38
sir
25:39
and come to you
