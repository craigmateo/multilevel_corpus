00:26
why don't why don't we go ahead and
00:27
start I apologize so we thought 200
00:31
would be enough and it's not so I
00:34
apologize for those of you asked us and
00:39
I'm mark Tate and I'm governor time you
00:43
actually introduce ourselves it's Tom
00:46
Landwehr the Commissioner Barton Natural
00:49
Resources very easily the chief
00:52
executive of Mesabi metallics and Mark
00:55
Phillips - Commissioner of I trow Barbie
00:59
what I'd like to do is say take 5
01:03
minutes 5 minutes 5 minutes and just
01:07
give you some background information so
01:09
if you just endure us for 15 minutes
01:12
then we'll have open it up to your
01:15
comments questions like oh that's
01:16
agreeable first thing I want to say is
01:20
you know we didn't pick our partners in
01:22
this undertaking Barbara or the
01:26
assistant commissioner of DNR is also
01:28
here you know when I arrived in January
01:32
of 2011
01:33
s-sir was the owner of the site the
01:35
project the land and they had the
01:38
mineral leases from the state from the
01:40
Department Natural Resources
01:42
after several broken promises by us or
01:45
we informed them we were gonna withdraw
01:47
the saint's leases and their response
01:50
was to file for bankruptcy which put it
01:53
into federal court in Delaware and again
01:58
we don't have didn't have ownership per
02:00
se of the project we had our leases were
02:02
part of that bankruptcy package their
02:06
creditors who were owed the considerable
02:08
several hundred million dollars
02:10
there were arranged contractors who were
02:12
owed about 46 million dollars and all
02:15
that got balled up and under federal
02:17
bankruptcy law into one proceeding and
02:20
the Bankruptcy Court judge in Delaware
02:23
ruled and in June of of 1970 of 2077 in
02:30
favor of Chippewa investors headed by
02:36
Tom Clark they bid reportedly about 250
02:39
million dollars for the all of the
02:41
assets and cliffs was the other bidder
02:45
it was a hundred million dollars we were
02:47
told so at that point of Tom Clark was
02:51
awarded by the judges the ownership of
02:54
the the site the project and the leases
02:58
from the state of Minnesota start out
03:01
very promising he paid back about forty
03:03
six million dollars that were owed to
03:05
Iron Range contractors that was part of
03:07
his commitments that made it appealing
03:10
first to all of us and as then this next
03:15
year unfolded we gave him various
03:18
timelines the DNR negotiated a much
03:21
tougher lease set of lease conditions
03:24
then existed with s-sir previously and
03:27
the DNR can elaborate on those but 250
03:31
million dollars of equity money coming
03:34
into the project was turned out game
03:36
from nu by nu by into PI you buy company
03:41
and country of Dubai I had to look at my
03:44
map as long as it's Canada as long as
03:47
there's good American money that's the
03:49
main consideration anyway his last
03:52
spring unbeknownst to us and I don't
03:56
understand behind the scenes but the
03:59
owners mr. Clark and Dubai got into a
04:03
tangle and the Board of Directors out
04:07
said mr. Clark and I notice that mr.
04:10
easily it was going to be the CEO of the
04:14
project and he's taking it from there
04:17
and he'll elaborate on that surely again
04:22
the leases the state has no ownership
04:23
over the property over the project site
04:28
or the any aspect of that we own are the
04:34
these are the mineral assets if you have
04:37
maps aerial sea and Tom can elaborate on
04:41
it but you'll see the generals site the
04:45
region and then you'll see specifically
04:47
the site and then you can see just some
04:49
above them they're kind of the gray area
04:52
just above the map
04:54
appear that's the location of the
04:58
project so at this point I wish it were
05:06
all set I wish were underway and we've
05:09
been told that full-bore construction
05:12
will begin in next March I sound as soon
05:15
as I would like but a lot of people who
05:19
have been told that we would have the
05:22
option just to was throw all the leases
05:24
and give them to somebody else and
05:27
that's just not correct now this is part
05:30
of the bankruptcy package the federal
05:33
judge will order that package which
05:34
included the state's mineral leases to
05:37
Chippewa DNR negotiated better terms
05:41
after was clear of the Bankruptcy Court
05:43
judge was going to award those leases to
05:45
shahbazi or negotiated much better terms
05:49
the only way in which we could make now
05:55
Mesabi metallic surrender those lease
05:59
rights would be if somebody else bought
06:02
them out which is always optional
06:05
somebody come in and make them an offer
06:07
as could happen and the bankruptcy Percy
06:10
or somebody could come in and and offer
06:15
to go into partnership with them and
06:17
share that that asset but other than
06:20
that we'd have to wait for the project's
06:23
to go bankrupt and in that case if gahl
06:27
collapsed
06:28
whether it was in bankruptcy court or
06:29
whether it was just lying fallow we
06:33
could retain the leases but they're you
06:35
know they're you know nothing there
06:36
other than the those minerals themselves
06:39
and there is value there's no question
06:41
is reportedly the best remaining iron
06:46
ore deposit anywhere in the range so
06:49
it's is valuable but it's valuable only
06:53
if it can be used for something and
06:55
that's what wasabi metallics I said
06:58
they're gonna do
06:59
we'll find out I've been like all of you
07:03
burned more times than I can count up on
07:05
the Iron Range
07:06
with projects and promises so I'm a
07:10
skeptic but I don't see I don't see any
07:14
alternative and they carry it forward
07:17
with myself in italics they put 200 and
07:21
dispute about hundreds over 175 million
07:24
and 250 million into the project as
07:28
serious money they paid back the
07:29
contractors we know that 46 million
07:31
dollars that's serious money they've got
07:34
other investments in the project itself
07:37
that's all serious money so I can't see
07:40
anybody we voluntarily walking away from
07:42
that well in which case it would be
07:44
pretty much worthless it's not as
07:47
clear-cut as a wish but it is what it is
07:50
and as I say there there's no there's no
07:51
viable alternative other than the hope
07:54
or make the thing go under and then pick
07:57
up the pieces from there so was that
07:59
special Andrew you want to elaborate on
08:01
the situation thank you very much
08:05
governor I think you know it as Gummer
08:07
governor indicated the process by which
08:09
we convey the state mineral leases is
08:12
laid out very prescriptively in statute
08:14
we just don't have sort of broad
08:15
authority to terminate its initiate
08:17
leases the legislature wants it to be a
08:19
predictable and an objective process and
08:23
so that's what we're dealing with so
08:24
between the the bankruptcy court and the
08:28
statutes we were dealt a particular hand
08:30
of cars and that's what we're playing
08:31
with the governor mentioned some
08:33
conditions that we got by virtue of the
08:35
leases we got some additional conditions
08:37
as well to hold these leases while
08:40
Mesabi was working through some issues
08:42
these are some additional conditions
08:44
that had to be met they had to make the
08:46
final payments on mechanic's liens as a
08:48
governor indicated 46 million dollars
08:50
they have to have offtake agreements for
08:52
4.2 million tons of pellets which they
08:54
have binding and enforceable
08:56
construction agreements with contractors
08:58
those general contractors are Minnesota
09:00
companies that was not something we
09:01
required but they put in there they have
09:03
to have ownership or leases of the
09:05
minerals formerly owned by superior they
09:07
have to have binding and enforceable
09:08
debt or equity commitments we required
09:11
that to be equal to 850 million dollars
09:13
it appears they have nine
09:15
dollars of equity and debt commitment so
09:17
they've exceeded that a letter of credit
09:19
to DNR for security of a royalty
09:20
payments we've got that four million
09:22
dollar letter of credit to beginning
09:23
this year and then they have to perform
09:25
all of those other lease obligations
09:27
that are in the lease document itself
09:29
this was this was a separate agreement
09:31
these are some of the key milestones
09:33
going forward so Mesabi italics has to
09:36
commence construction of value-added
09:37
that's a direct reduced iron ore hbi Hut
09:41
vachetta iron ore some similar similar
09:45
high-value iron like pig iron you have
09:48
to commence construction of that
09:49
facility by the end of this year you
09:51
know what are we talking three months no
09:53
they have to complete construction of
09:55
the pellet plant by December 31st of
09:57
next year they have to ship at least
09:59
three million tons of pellets by the end
10:00
of 2020 they have to complete
10:02
construction of value-added facility by
10:04
December 31st 2021 and so on and so in
10:07
in short we have conditions on those
10:10
leases that they have to meet going
10:12
forward and this gives us the
10:13
opportunity to take steps if they fail
10:18
to meet them on the bottom or some of
10:19
the steps we can take if they fail to
10:21
meet these obligations they cannot
10:23
distribute equity back to shareholders
10:25
in other words if you're a shareholder
10:26
in the company you cannot get a payment
10:28
until all of our say all of our
10:31
conditions are satisfied the one of the
10:34
penalties is that or one of the
10:36
considerations they have to have minimum
10:37
royalties paid to the Department of six
10:39
million nine million and eleven point
10:41
eight million if they fail to meet these
10:42
obligations so it's this serious
10:44
financial penalty as well and then if
10:47
they fail to meet obligations we will
10:49
double the rent and royalties over to
10:52
the state if they meet some of these
10:53
construction and production timelines so
10:55
very serious consequences if the company
10:59
fails to meet their obligations I think
11:03
the key point that we really want to
11:05
make tonight this is something hopefully
11:07
I'll have a copy of the map this is the
11:09
current ownership pattern at the mine
11:13
pit now let me explain what you're
11:15
looking at at the map here a little bit
11:18
the black line indicates the currently
11:21
permitted mine now under Minnesota law
11:24
you have to get a permit to
11:26
mine too do any of these projects and
11:28
that permit to mine indicates exactly
11:30
where the mine pit is this is what's
11:33
currently in the permit to mine that s
11:35
are obtained that now Mesabi metallics
11:37
holds you cannot do any mining absent a
11:40
permit to mine and so this is the only
11:42
permitted mine
11:44
in that area right now this shows by the
11:47
three colors the control of those
11:49
mineral rights now let me quickly add
11:52
that the mineral rights that are held by
11:54
cliffs are currently under litigation in
11:57
District Court and so that is that is as
12:00
currently available right now but that
12:02
could change depending on a district
12:04
court ruling so what you're looking at
12:06
there is in blue is Mesabi metallics
12:10
100% control this is what they own or
12:12
lease 100% control 54% of the mine pit
12:16
is controlled by Masonic metallics not
12:18
all of that is state leases there's a
12:20
little bit of private lease in there but
12:22
the bulk of that is state minerals in
12:24
the yellow 325 acres that's jointly
12:28
controlled by a Mesaba italics and
12:30
cliffs in other words there's a 50/50
12:33
ownership of those mineral rights and
12:35
state law provides for how you handle
12:38
that one of the the the one of those
12:41
entities can mine those resources they
12:43
have to pay the other entity for the
12:46
profit on those resources that's laid
12:48
out in state law and a court has to
12:49
approve how that happens that's about 41
12:52
percent of the pit and the remaining red
12:56
41 acres is what cliffs owns has 100%
13:00
control of but again that is what's
13:02
being contested in district court right
13:04
now if you step back and go to the
13:08
bigger picture this map shows a larger
13:12
area obviously those those brown lines
13:14
above and below that is the iron
13:16
formation through the range the you can
13:19
see the oval in the center that is the
13:23
pit that we saw in the previous picture
13:24
and the red polygons are those mineral
13:29
assets that are held by cliffs so you
13:32
can see that yes cliffs holds a
13:33
substantial amount of acreage of mineral
13:36
rights in the area
13:37
but very very little in the pit proper a
13:40
couple of other things I'd note on that
13:42
the permit to mind that currently miss
13:45
Hobby metallics holds also includes the
13:49
areas that are in the stockpile to the
13:52
north the the plant to the north and the
13:54
tailings basin to the east that is all
13:57
under the control of the sabi metallics
13:59
what you don't see in here is what is
14:01
owned by Mesabi metallics and it is a
14:03
large geography around that area so as I
14:07
mentioned it includes those those
14:08
processing areas as well as the tailings
14:11
base and so Mesabi metallics owns
14:13
several thousand acres in the area
14:15
Cliff's own several thousand acres in
14:17
the area there is opportunity there for
14:20
mining cliff says obviously got some
14:22
substantial opportunity for mining there
14:23
they have never submitted a request to a
14:25
permit to mine to my knows those
14:28
resources but they have that ability to
14:30
do so in the future governor I'd just
14:33
close by mentioning everybody has a
14:35
opportunity to copy the FAQ the
14:37
frequently asked questions we're gonna
14:39
put that last slide back up and then
14:42
I'll turn over to Gary Easley okay
14:50
thanks to everybody for coming tonight
14:52
you know it's impressive to see so many
14:54
people come out to talk about a project
14:57
like this that can have a huge impact on
14:59
this community you start thinking about
15:01
what this project means to them to the
15:04
Iron Range and we're talking about
15:06
multi-generational high value jobs I
15:08
grew up in an area that was a steel town
15:10
and when I was a kid
15:12
I watched the layoffs roll through that
15:14
town like a freight train and what was
15:16
left in the wake was economic
15:18
devastation it was incredibly
15:20
frustrating to watch these
15:22
hundred-year-old steelmaking operations
15:24
just one by one go down so I know how
15:28
important it is to keep high-value jobs
15:30
you know in a community and and what
15:33
happens to a community when they go away
15:34
right we also know that no market stands
15:37
still right so the iron ore market and
15:41
this in this country has gone through
15:43
some really difficult times for those of
15:44
you that have been around a long time
15:45
you know back in the early 2000s when
15:48
all those blast furnace companies those
15:50
those integrated operators win
15:51
to bankruptcy Cleveland cliffs played a
15:54
critical role in keeping those companies
15:56
alive and bringing them back they were
15:59
actively involved actually I was
16:00
involved in some of those projects with
16:02
cliffs helping them bring those furnaces
16:04
back bring those companies back and
16:06
restore market that could have gone away
16:08
so I know that cliffs has been a
16:10
critical element of bringing economic
16:13
value to this Iron Range and I've worked
16:15
with some of those people for years I've
16:16
known Lorenzo a long time you know he's
16:18
an impressive guy I've got a lot of
16:20
respect for him he's done a lot of great
16:22
things and the people in cliffs are
16:23
great bunch of people but the truth of
16:26
the matter is that no market can stand
16:27
still I saw that as a child as I watched
16:29
the market that supported my town
16:31
disappeared so we don't ever want to see
16:34
that happen again so when you start
16:35
looking forward in the Iron Range and
16:37
say where do we go from here the last
16:38
hundred years has been pretty good but
16:40
where do we go from here and there are a
16:42
couple of answers one is that you've got
16:44
to tap into more resources you've got to
16:46
continue to responsively to responsibly
16:50
develop the resources that are up here
16:52
that is really as you know such a
16:55
critical element of this community and
16:56
what what has driven your economic
16:59
success for the last hundred years
17:01
you've got to continue to move forward
17:03
the other question is where do your
17:05
pellets go where does this product go
17:07
and what we've seen over the last
17:09
decades is a continuous decline of
17:12
market share by the blast furnace
17:15
community meanwhile we've seen the
17:17
entire steel industry in the United
17:19
States and Canada you know have this
17:20
dramatic shift to a totally different
17:23
balance it used to be 90% blast furnace
17:25
then 80 then fit now it's less than 50%
17:27
blast furnace in order to keep moving
17:30
forward as a community it's not just
17:33
about developing those resources you've
17:34
got to get out and access the markets
17:36
and the markets have changed now what's
17:40
cliffs doing about that well you look at
17:41
what they're doing down in Ohio they I
17:43
don't know why it's Ohio but they
17:44
decided to build a DRI facility in Ohio
17:46
to go ahead and access those markets
17:48
what's it what's it mean here as we
17:51
bring this project up the goal isn't
17:53
just a dump more pellets into the blast
17:55
furnace market it is to go into the
17:57
value-added products just as cliffs is
17:59
doing that would allow this this
18:00
business Mesabi metallics to access an
18:03
entirely
18:04
different market that has never been
18:06
available to this community before right
18:08
so these are critical elements of how
18:10
you move forward and when I look back at
18:11
what I saw as a child is my community
18:13
really crumbled under the weight of bad
18:16
business models and and you know a
18:18
failure to adapt to changing times I see
18:21
here a chance to do the exact opposite
18:23
and if you look forward 20 and 30 years
18:26
so if this isn't about the people in
18:27
this room right it's about your children
18:30
and your grandchildren it's about them
18:32
having the same opportunities you had
18:34
right that's why we're here when you
18:37
really get down to what it all means now
18:39
I've been here for less time than any of
18:41
you you all know probably more about
18:42
this project than I do you certainly
18:43
been on the range longer than I have
18:45
been
18:46
all right I've been up here a bunch of
18:47
times over the years seeing some
18:48
projects but but this is really the
18:51
first time I've had a chance to dive
18:53
into this project I've been hearing
18:54
about this for 20 years I've been
18:56
hearing about this asset being developed
18:58
for two decades and I've never quite
19:01
understood you know why it never came to
19:03
market well you know I know that this
19:05
has been a troubled history I know that
19:07
you know obviously it was a bankruptcy
19:08
but when I finally got on site and got
19:11
to look around there's some things that
19:13
cannot be missed one it's a great site
19:16
it's an absolutely fantastic place to
19:18
put a mine
19:19
it's a brownfield site so a lot of the
19:22
infrastructure that's required is you
19:23
know in place and when you look at what
19:25
happened with the money invested so far
19:29
there are hundreds and hundreds of
19:31
millions of dollars worth of
19:33
construction already in place that can
19:36
be used going forward now we haven't
19:38
changed the plan right the plan isn't
19:41
different than it was so those buildings
19:44
that you see as you drive down the road
19:45
you can sort of see over the trees all
19:47
those get used all that construction
19:49
work done done by people who live here
19:51
right all that work is still in place
19:55
and to move forward you just pick up the
19:57
wrenches and go right I've never seen
20:00
that before
20:00
I've done ground you know Brene brown
20:02
field and green field construction
20:04
projects and I've been involved in lots
20:06
of different things I've never seen a
20:07
situation where you can find a place
20:09
that's partially built and all the
20:12
assets in place are valuable so this is
20:15
a tremendous advantage it really makes
20:16
the project attractive
20:18
I think that's why you've seen one party
20:21
after another try to come in and make
20:22
this happen right so there's some really
20:24
good facts when you think about what
20:27
happened as the company slipped into
20:29
bankruptcy and and went through that
20:31
terrible period the the chippewa group
20:34
right the folks who brought me in they
20:36
they invested during the bankruptcy
20:39
period really before they even had a
20:41
plan and had it successfully emerged
20:43
they didn't even have leases they didn't
20:44
have all of that done normally you don't
20:47
put any money in until you got the lease
20:48
is secured who would do that but they
20:50
did right and they put more than two
20:52
hundred million dollars into Mesabi
20:54
metallics during the bankruptcy and
20:57
after to do a couple of things some
21:00
really important things one they pray
21:02
they paid a bunch of the contractors and
21:04
pre petitioned creditors who were owed
21:06
money by the project right that money
21:09
came out went right into this community
21:11
now I've never seen that before
21:13
typically when you see a bankruptcy and
21:16
somebody emerges like that
21:17
anyone with a prepetition claim might
21:18
get a note if there's a really high
21:20
value sale they might get some cash but
21:22
but to emerge and spend so much of the
21:26
available capital on paying the local
21:29
community for the work that had been
21:30
done prior to the bankruptcy is really
21:32
in my experience unique right now the
21:35
other thing that had to happen they had
21:36
to buy some land so some land
21:38
acquisitions were made there are a lot
21:40
of fees and things that happened but the
21:43
good news is there has been steady
21:44
construction going on on the site for at
21:46
least 15 months that's not necessarily
21:49
to level it like I'd like to see it
21:51
increase a bit I think all of you would
21:52
like to see it increase a bit but it has
21:54
been steadily going forward for months
21:57
there were people on site today working
21:59
on the project most of that work has
22:01
been done and what we call the in
22:03
duration building again you folks you
22:05
know been around this a long time you
22:07
know it's a critical element of the
22:08
pellet production process so the money
22:11
is going into you know an element where
22:14
all that helps us advance the project
22:16
and advance the schedule so it's another
22:19
sort of good fact here now having put in
22:22
the 200 plus million dollars that have
22:24
gone into the project in the last 15
22:26
months Mesabi metallics as you heard had
22:29
a bunch of deadlines it had to be met
22:31
some preconditions that had to be met in
22:33
order to win the Lisa's back in order to
22:36
meet some of the regulatory permit
22:39
related issues as well and as we've
22:42
watched the project move forward the
22:43
company has done those things it has
22:45
done what it was required to do in order
22:47
to get the leases reinstated so now
22:50
you've got a project with leases in hand
22:52
permits in hand you've got a mining plan
22:54
that is already permitted you've got
22:57
equipment on site that is partially
23:00
constructed you've got equipment in some
23:02
of our vendors warehouses that's already
23:04
constructed and ready to ship the site
23:06
this is an extraordinarily good
23:08
situation for a project that's gone
23:11
through this kind of trouble now you
23:13
know in order to move forward we've got
23:15
a lot of work to do we've got to finish
23:17
some engineering we've got to continue
23:19
to meet the conditions of our creditors
23:21
we have to do the things necessary to
23:23
drive the project to a successful
23:25
conclusion and that's what the mission
23:26
is so we're picking up the pieces and
23:29
kind of cleaning up some of the some of
23:32
the chaos and driving this thing forward
23:33
in a more orderly fashion you take no
23:36
did you take one more minute and just
23:39
tell people your experience in this
23:41
industry which is sure well sure yeah
23:44
I've been around the steel related
23:46
industries for a very long time you know
23:48
I've been involved in projects with
23:50
companies you well there's an SDI person
23:52
in the room I worked with SDI for a
23:54
while and everything from steelmaking
23:56
actually spent some time up here working
23:58
on one of their projects down into
24:00
fabrication I've done a lot of
24:01
turnaround work back as I said during
24:04
the bankruptcies in the early 2000s when
24:07
it kind of looked like a lot of these
24:09
blast furnaces were gonna be permanently
24:11
gone which for this region would have
24:13
been uttered devastation I was involved
24:16
in something like ten of those
24:17
bankruptcies helping find a path out and
24:19
with most of those companies at least
24:23
parts of them survived so much so that
24:26
the mines up here kept making iron ore
24:27
because if those mills went down if
24:29
those furnaces stopped cooking iron the
24:33
range would stop so I was involved in a
24:35
lot of that work and I've done a lot of
24:37
financing and mergers and acquisitions
24:39
type work I've done a lot of operations
24:41
I've spent time in commercials so I've
24:42
sort of been in a lot of seats and
24:44
all of that comes together to allow me
24:47
to come in and kind of quickly assess
24:48
what's going on here and figure out what
24:50
we have to do to start driving forward
24:51
and that's the mission it's quite simple
24:53
so that we have raise your hand if you
24:58
have one of the microphones that okay
25:01
governor we have people with the blue
25:03
jackets we'll have the microphones okay
25:05
thank you very much for doing that so
25:07
questions comments you start here thank
25:15
you Gary and Commissioner a question for
25:18
you to major stipulations for the
25:20
reinstatement of this leases to Mesabi
25:23
we're supposed to be getting
25:24
construction financing and getting off
25:27
take real offtake agreements with all
25:30
the madness confusion and craziness
25:32
thrown Esser chippewa tom clark who by
25:35
riverdale merida Miranda venner McCrea
25:40
etc who exactly has the 650 million
25:44
dollar backing from asabi now and who
25:48
exactly is the off taker where these
25:50
pellets are going to be used so the
25:52
financing that was put in place well
25:54
let's back up one step further you know
25:55
there were construction contracts that
25:57
had to be put in place in May those were
25:59
done with local contractors that I think
26:00
all of you know then in in June there
26:03
was a requirement to put the financing
26:04
in place that financing was put in place
26:07
by a trading group and the lead arranger
26:11
there is a group called Riverdale
26:12
Riverdale will provide an off take
26:15
they've provided an off take so that the
26:16
pellets can be sold and they can access
26:18
any market globally so there's no
26:20
limitation on where they go that
26:23
financing that 650-million agreement is
26:26
in place and we now are doing the things
26:28
that we have to do to meet the
26:29
preconditions so we can access that
26:31
funding so that's where we are right now
26:33
okay yes you know more specific so we
26:37
have an off taker a broker for develop
26:38
do you have the final home or
26:40
destination for the pellet now these
26:43
pellets can be traded out into the
26:44
global markets and we've got a lot of
26:46
time to finally determine which furnaces
26:49
they go into right they'll have to be
26:51
some testing done I mean it you it
26:52
sounds like you've probably been around
26:53
the iron ore business awhile so you know
26:55
what has to happen to go
26:56
actually in land in a furnace and start
26:58
making iron ore or making metal you know
27:01
making metal so that'll be something
27:04
that happens concurrent with all the
27:06
construction activity we got time to get
27:07
that done so right now we we don't have
27:09
a sales contract or a customer don't
27:12
know
27:12
now you're jumping ahead a bit I'm not
27:15
sure what you think here so we've got an
27:17
off take agreement in place to market
27:19
these pellets we don't currently have
27:21
any pellets right so before we can
27:24
actually sell them into a furnace we
27:26
have to make them right so what's gonna
27:29
happen is as we finish construction
27:30
right our off takers will market these
27:33
pellets we will find the final sources
27:35
and homes just as we're all set up
27:37
before all these pellets in the past had
27:39
also found homes right so not sure where
27:43
you're going with it but the thing I'm
27:46
not worried about right now is where
27:47
these pellets land the market is you
27:50
know very strong there are lots of
27:52
places to go and as we move into the
27:53
value-added market and his cliffs moves
27:55
into the value-added market we open up
27:57
vast new opportunities that aren't even
27:59
available to the Iron Range today
28:02
somebody else somebody else's hands here
28:04
yes hi governor Dayton thank you my name
28:11
is andreas upon such I'm mayor of
28:12
Babbitt you talked about you came from a
28:15
town mr. Easley sorry that you know you
28:18
saw the steel in the you know everyone
28:19
close down and out well our town it's
28:21
pretty much there it used to be over
28:22
3500 or 3500 people I saw pictures of
28:27
what it used to be I saw what the school
28:29
used to look like we're down to one
28:30
school or kids classes are getting cut
28:32
etc so Cleveland Cliffs is our major
28:37
employer in the city and I'm here with a
28:39
number of elected officials from the
28:41
range area so we are all here
28:43
representing communities that benefit
28:45
greatly from Cliffs operations I have
28:48
some questions though in regards to
28:50
leases and I'm just gonna say the answer
28:52
you know to say the questions I deal
28:55
with contracts and if the construction
28:58
doesn't start by the end of this year
28:59
what happens then and then also if it's
29:01
not completed by 2019 then what happens
29:04
I mean do we keep on going all the way
29:06
on down to 2023 you know
29:09
and people are supposed to be getting
29:10
money and then if doubling the
29:12
consequences is a reaction of the you
29:16
know if they don't fulfill the terms
29:17
then what does it take to terminate
29:20
those leases now cliffs has the
29:23
commercial and operating expertise as an
29:26
desi merchant is the company that will
29:28
maximize production for both blast and
29:30
arc furnaces and they are generating
29:32
lots of cash right now I don't
29:34
understand if Mesabi metallics doesn't
29:37
come forthwith even just the closest one
29:39
right now which is December 2018 what's
29:41
it going to take and why can't the state
29:43
meet with mr. Gonzales and come to an
29:46
agreement I just
29:55
I agree with everything you said and I'm
29:59
sure also about about cliffs you know
30:01
they've been a very important leader in
30:04
the industry here in a soda and
30:06
elsewhere and they employ 850 people
30:09
North Shore and up here so I want a good
30:15
relationship there I want those
30:17
continuing relationships and you know
30:19
whatever else again they own sites where
30:21
they could request from DNR permit to
30:24
mine if they want to build as I've read
30:26
mr. Gonzales has said they want to build
30:29
a plant if they want to build a
30:32
value-added plant here you know they can
30:34
begin that that process is eight that
30:36
they haven't done so and so you know is
30:40
where it is we don't have the ability
30:41
since this is now owned by massabi
30:44
Metellus to go out and negotiate with
30:46
somebody else I mean that wouldn't that
30:48
probably illegal but it certainly
30:50
wouldn't be proper but you want to talk
30:51
about the lease
30:53
sure let me and some of this have been
30:55
in the media so I apologize if you've
30:57
heard this before but I started out by
30:59
mentioning this is this is a statutory
31:01
very prescriptive process to do skate
31:03
mineral leases and and right now the
31:07
only that permit to mine is only viable
31:12
under that those mineral leases are only
31:15
viable under that larger permit to mine
31:17
okay that permit to mine is given for an
31:19
entire project so it's all of the
31:21
facilities it's all of the processes
31:23
it's all of the construction that has to
31:25
happen and if the only way we can convey
31:28
those leases is by conveying that permit
31:32
to mine so that whole permit to mine has
31:34
to go so that means anybody who wants to
31:36
get those leases has to take on that
31:39
whole project and that's what happened
31:41
to the bankruptcy proceeding right so
31:42
the Bankruptcy Court put it up for for
31:44
bid got two bids one hundred seven
31:46
hundred million from cliffs and 250 from
31:49
from Tom Clark and so bankruptcy judge
31:53
awarded it to Poseidon almost hobby
31:56
metallics we can't there are a couple of
31:59
provisions in the in
32:00
documents we've got to allow us to
32:02
terminate the leases if they don't
32:03
finish construction on the Pell plant by
32:05
December of next year we can terminate
32:06
the lease if they don't provide three
32:08
million tons of ore by December 31st
32:12
2020 we can terminate the lease so we
32:13
have we have options to terminate that
32:17
that project but if that happens if that
32:21
happens and that project disappears
32:24
those leases only become available
32:27
through the regular statutorily
32:30
described process and that means that
32:32
somebody submits to us a permit to mine
32:33
that means we start the clock all over
32:35
again at 12 o'clock and that means
32:37
somebody comes in with a permit to mine
32:39
that requires all of the environmental
32:41
review requires all of the permits not
32:44
just a permit to mine but their air
32:46
quality permit the water quality permit
32:48
you know any number of permits all of
32:50
that is in a really good situation would
32:53
take six years to complete so if we
32:55
eliminated this project and we were able
32:58
to convey those leases to another entity
33:00
cliffs or otherwise nothing's gonna
33:03
happen for at least six years so so
33:05
right now given that process and given
33:07
where we are with the Mesabi of italics
33:09
we're moving ahead seeing that is the
33:11
most viable option to get something
33:13
going up here in this project governor
33:19
Dayton my name's Annie lebarge and I'm
33:21
here to represent all of us at United
33:23
taconite and I'm sure I can speak a lot
33:25
for our brothers and sisters at Hibbing
33:27
taconite we've been through the toughest
33:29
times with cliffs
33:30
Lorenzo we call him uncle Larry and we
33:33
we have known to trust him in his word
33:35
our family is friends coworkers
33:38
businesses all support Cleveland Cliffs
33:40
and we support what cliffs is trying to
33:43
do here my question to all the
33:45
politicians and leaders that have a hand
33:47
in this Fiasco is this if you do not
33:49
support cliffs we don't support you do
33:52
you hear us
33:56
I don't know what supporting cliffs
34:05
means you I have great respect as I said
34:07
for what they're doing up here as their
34:10
sites we have to follow the law we had
34:12
to holding s thrown into bankruptcy we
34:15
had to follow federal law under
34:16
bankruptcy we have to follow state and
34:18
federal law we supporting cliffs is not
34:21
the point of the where we are today
34:24
they haven't if ifs cliffs had made
34:27
competitive offer in bankruptcy they
34:29
donated a if they wanted to take over
34:32
the project and the existing permit to
34:34
mine they have to buy it from the
34:36
president owner Mesabi metallics the
34:38
state doesn't own the project
34:40
we own the land which has Marilee says
34:44
now in the hands of a savvy metallics
34:46
that's that's they have that legal legal
34:50
right and we're going with what is
34:53
existing because we don't have the power
34:56
or the authority to just say well we're
34:58
done with we're done with you we're just
35:00
gonna take pass it on your cliffs we
35:02
don't have that authority just just a
35:06
comment I mean I can sense the passion
35:08
with which you from cliffs are looking
35:11
at this and it's a little surprising
35:12
because I hadn't seen this before
35:14
I've certainly heard what Lorenzo said
35:16
and like you I trust Lorenzo and I've
35:18
known him a long time and I think he's a
35:19
great guy but no one has done anything
35:22
to Cleveland cliffs here as I understand
35:24
it and you all know better than I I
35:25
don't think this site has been mine
35:27
since maybe the 80s was it the 80s that
35:29
last time was mine so this has been an
35:31
idle piece of property for decades and
35:34
at least for 20 years or so different
35:37
groups have been trying to figure out
35:38
how to make this work and I don't
35:42
remember cliffs ever doing that and I so
35:44
I don't understand you know exactly what
35:46
you think people have taken from cliffs
35:48
but no one's taken anything from cliffs
35:50
if cliffs wants to develop new mines
35:53
they're free to go do it if they want to
35:54
invest in their existing mines they do
35:55
and they and they're free to do that
35:58
cliffs hasn't been blocked or or
36:00
nothing's been done to cliffs right so I
36:03
so it could be that you're just maybe
36:06
you're looking at this in a way that I
36:08
don't understand it'd be one thing if
36:10
somebody did every single thing they
36:12
could do to try to kill a project right
36:15
but not do anything to develop a project
36:18
now that I could see that making people
36:20
angry but no one has harmed cliffs in
36:23
any way cliffs has total freedom to do
36:26
whatever they want and if the land that
36:29
they've got leases on they want to mine
36:31
they can take the years and years and
36:32
invest the millions and they will do
36:34
that that's a hundred years of history
36:35
with cliffs doing that right so I don't
36:39
see a problem here I don't see the fight
36:41
remember this the key to moving your
36:43
communities forward isn't about battling
36:45
between corporations that's not going to
36:47
do anything the key to moving your
36:49
communities forward is developing
36:51
resources to be cost competitive
36:53
globally and accessing the right markets
36:56
and again I point to what cliffs is
36:57
doing down in Ohio in building that
36:59
value-added plan to make DRI that is a
37:02
brilliant move that opens up a market
37:04
that's been out there for decades and
37:06
decades that cliffs is never accessed
37:07
that opens up great new opportunities
37:09
for cliffs and I think it's really
37:11
important for the range right now well
37:14
then you know that's a question for
37:16
local folks to ask maybe but but I'm
37:18
sure that they picked that site for
37:19
great reasons and I don't know what
37:21
those are I wasn't involved but this
37:24
company massabi metalitz has done
37:27
nothing to Cleveland cliff C to harm
37:29
them in any way so sure yes sir thank
37:34
you my name is Dave cart Ella before I
37:37
asked a question for mr. Easley I want
37:40
to make sure you understand something
37:41
that's important this map really
37:44
misleading okay see this only shows the
37:49
hundred percent on cliffs but we own and
37:51
share a lot for the larger permit to
37:53
mine area with you 5050 actually about a
37:56
billion tons worth of ore right here at
37:58
this site okay that's about 50% of the
38:01
available resource on the site anyway my
38:05
question for you because we own 50% all
38:08
of this with with you through here
38:10
through here through here is as a
38:11
businessman okay
38:13
when cliffs owns that much iron ore a
38:17
billion tons of the resource all
38:19
throughout this site not not just the
38:21
immediate in the immediate permit area
38:24
that'll be mind in the beginning but for
38:26
the whole site how do you go forward
38:28
with such a massive investment almost a
38:30
billion dollars when cliffs owns that
38:32
much or in opposition at this point and
38:35
the state of Minnesota has already
38:38
proclaimed as recently as last month
38:39
that they they considered Mesabi
38:42
metallics in violation of their
38:44
agreement and could pull the leases if
38:45
they wanted to with those two factors in
38:48
mind how do you go forward with that and
38:49
then you know well I'll let you answer
38:52
that so so here's the thing there's
38:55
well-established law in precedent for
38:57
how you deal with these mineral leases
38:59
right and yeah there's a lot of disputes
39:00
and litigation going on over the control
39:03
of this land but right now Mesabi
39:06
metallics has all the necessary permits
39:08
to mine that land and has got a mine
39:10
plan approved and has invested literally
39:13
hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of
39:15
millions of dollars to mine it and if
39:18
cliffs wants to do something I suppose
39:19
they can start the work to start doing
39:21
that but but this hasn't been done to
39:24
hurt Cleveland cliffs in fact I think
39:25
cliffs invest in this after the fact
40:05
no I never said I no sir I never said
40:08
that I said you could make a case for
40:10
that we're gonna have to go to court
40:12
they could contest that we'd be tied up
40:14
in court for at least two years I never
40:16
said we don't have the authority the
40:18
people seem to believe we have to just
40:21
yank these leases and give them somebody
40:23
else we don't have that authority and
40:25
I'd flip it a little bit on you there
40:27
and ask you a question so if this mine
40:29
gets developed right and you've got
40:32
multi generate Marty generational
40:34
high-value jobs what are you upset about
40:37
why do you care I mean I don't know if
40:40
that's that question and I will answer
40:41
it okay because I think the governor
40:43
made a misstatement earlier as well okay
40:45
when you when you said cliffs hasn't
40:47
lost anything okay cliffs and governor
40:50
Dayton came to the range we had an
40:53
agreement they were going to work
40:54
together build this out Lorenzo we stood
40:57
together on site i sat across from you
40:59
at the dinner table you you said
41:01
specifically to me yes I'm not gonna say
41:04
I'm not gonna tell you again Lorenzo
41:06
that we'll have a deal because I don't
41:07
want to go back on my word again you
41:09
said that and I was there okay so you
41:12
know we made strategic plans around this
41:14
site we had engineering we had all kinds
41:17
of plans with our customers we had this
41:19
facility ready like cliffs has done time
41:22
and time again for the people on the
41:24
range we had it ready to bring it back
41:26
when the market was ready for it you
41:29
might say that the the electric arc
41:32
furnace market has been there for
41:34
decades for cliffs but you know if
41:35
you've been in this business that the
41:37
eaf market really wasn't ready for
41:39
high-grade high-grade steels they didn't
41:41
they didn't have that technology until
41:43
more recently they have any the market
41:44
hasn't been there okay but but you
41:47
governor to say that we haven't lost
41:49
anything you know you promised you knew
41:52
you knew and you admitted that you went
41:54
back on your word you know I went back I
41:56
monster let me answer that great you
41:59
know because my honesty integrity means
42:02
a lot to me and I've sent 40 plus years
42:05
up here doing every goddamn thing I
42:07
could to bring jobs the Iron Range
42:09
with one exception twin metals
42:11
everything else I supported everything
42:14
else I've done within the finds of the
42:16
law what I could I when I said that toe
42:19
Lorenzo it was before they went into
42:21
bankruptcy when there was nobody else
42:23
around when the market unemployment up
42:25
here and it didn't look like there's
42:27
anybody else around and I meant it
42:29
and I would have proceeded to do so
42:31
except they went into bankruptcy and I
42:33
don't have any standing in bankruptcy
42:34
the state of Minnesota doesn't the
42:36
creditors do and so we had to follow the
42:39
law and if if Chris wants to buy this
42:43
project they can buy it if cliff wants
42:46
to develop all those murals as they hold
42:48
leases sued now elsewhere they can file
42:52
a permit to my plan
42:53
you know the permit to my plan right now
42:55
is this been approved by DNR is that
42:57
narrow circle right there that's what's
43:00
in the permit to mine you can't go
43:02
outside that was the existing permit to
43:04
mine well they wanted everybody wants it
43:11
so a couple points so a couple of things
43:21
I worked with Cleveland close probably
43:24
13 years ago on iron making projects to
43:28
try to get into the electric arc furnace
43:29
market so your analysis the market may
43:32
not be correct you know there's a
43:34
company that has a steel mill in Indiana
43:35
that's been making its own iron probably
43:38
for 15 years something like that I'd
43:41
have to go look at the original years it
43:43
could be a little longer so the markets
43:45
actually been there for a long time
43:46
that's not a bad thing that's a good
43:48
thing right everybody's got to get into
43:50
that market now it's been if you look
43:53
globally at the processes to do that mid
43:56
dracs hyl and a lot of ones that have
43:58
been tried and failed there you know
44:00
there's paths into that market that's a
44:02
good thing I don't see that being a bad
44:04
thing and so I'm not sure where you're
44:05
coming from on that and and in terms of
44:08
this I was unaware that cliffs had owned
44:10
this property put a mining plan in place
44:12
spent the decades or the years and years
44:14
getting the permits I never knew that
44:16
happened because I don't think it did so
44:18
okay well then I misunderstood what you
44:20
were saying
44:22
so cliffs is synchronistic listens never
44:26
submitted an application for a permit to
44:27
mine in this area so we're talking about
44:31
a project it hasn't been mine since the
44:33
80s right where well whatever the
44:38
reasons I'm just telling you it's a it's
44:40
a giant economic development opportunity
44:42
for generations yep good evening
44:56
oh you go over there all right Thank You
45:00
governor good evening mr. Easley and
45:01
thank you for coming here to answer
45:04
questions tonight the one question I
45:06
have to answer your question why the as
45:09
you called it hostility towards this
45:11
project five million tons of pellets yes
45:14
the market is good now we just came out
45:17
of recession people at Utecht were laid
45:20
off
45:22
LTV steel mining company shut down two
45:24
thousand one seven and a half million
45:26
tons so when the next downturn comes is
45:30
it going to be hitting taconite is it
45:31
gonna be you tack is it going to be key
45:33
tack you know when you put this extra
45:36
tonnage on the market it is a direct
45:37
threat to the existing facilities
45:39
facilities I might add or represented by
45:42
the United Steelworkers they're
45:43
good-paying jobs they don't whether it
45:47
be cliffs or US Steel there's a definite
45:49
concern up here we've been through it in
45:51
Babbitt and white lakes and Aurora the
45:55
five million tons is a direct threat to
45:57
us oh you're absolutely right and that's
45:59
the reason when SR got this whole thing
46:01
going they made promises it was not
46:03
gonna just be taconite pellets produced
46:05
it was really value-added and mr eazi
46:08
said create take advantage of a new
46:11
market you're absolutely right and that
46:13
the drainage delegations express that
46:15
concern to chip wall and same thing so I
46:18
mean you're absolutely right governor I
46:20
agree with you and then we if they're
46:22
gonna develop a value-added project
46:23
that's a wonderful thing it's the five
46:25
million tons of pellets we know this is
46:28
a cyclical industry we've lived here for
46:29
many years I've been in the business
46:31
almost 28 years I've seen
46:34
three layoffs one permanent you know
46:37
that is a significant threat to us in
46:40
our lifestyle and our people so what is
46:43
your solution to have the project die
46:45
our solution was that we wished the
46:49
state would have never got involved in
46:50
this if you take the money you folks
46:52
have poured into this thing we could
46:54
have had DRI at one of the other
46:55
facilities you know key tech hipping
46:59
taconite is running out or key tech is
47:01
probably getting pretty close to the
47:03
edges of their property that that war
47:05
would have been mined you know this this
47:08
project the state sponsorship of this
47:10
project the government that money's been
47:12
poured into it you know I guess that's
47:15
that's the frustration from the people
47:17
the money that's been poured the good
47:19
money after bad the promises that aren't
47:22
kept the extensions it's it's and then
47:28
on top of that so I wanted to answer
47:29
your question sir again thank you for
47:30
coming in and you know answering some
47:33
questions for us yeah it's always great
47:36
to hear that perspective you know and to
47:37
understand where you're coming from and
47:39
you know I I don't mean to keep going
47:42
back to the same thing but I grew up in
47:44
a place where they were all usw jobs
47:46
right and they were really high paying
47:49
jobs and people come out of high school
47:50
walk across the mill and boy they'd be
47:52
in there for the rest of their careers
47:54
and they all went away and the primary
47:56
reason they went away is because new
47:58
investments weren't being made and and
48:00
no matter what corporation owns the
48:03
assets up here and I'm just speaking not
48:05
to the project but to this range and to
48:06
my personal experience watching valuable
48:10
companies go away you know during the
48:13
the bad times the steel industry face I
48:15
worked like I said on like 10
48:16
bankruptcies I've seen thousands and
48:19
thousands of jobs saved but I've also
48:21
seen situations where the investments
48:23
weren't made and the and the companies
48:26
went away and towns were devastated what
48:29
this project represents for the Iron
48:30
Range is a long-term economic
48:33
opportunity and it's you know it's for
48:36
you but really it's for your children
48:39
and grandchildren and in the town I grew
48:40
up in all those folks many of those
48:42
folks left some of them found a way to
48:44
keep going but the economic activity
48:47
never
48:47
covered here with this project decades
48:51
and decades of high-value jobs so I
48:53
understand exactly what you're saying
48:54
right there with you I understand the
48:57
concern about competition but remember
48:58
no market ever stands still you've got
49:01
to move into the future what you need we
49:04
have the mayor of barrows next but you
49:06
need to understand we won't we have
49:08
heard that before you know you're coming
49:10
in a situation not a clean slate you're
49:12
coming in where those assurances promise
49:14
have been made and haven't been
49:16
fulfilled so mayor and so just a note on
49:19
hip tech we are aware that hip tech is
49:22
facing you know limitations on or we've
49:25
been working with them to look for other
49:27
state leases we're also we also know in
49:34
our facilitating conversations between
49:36
they and some private mineral holders
49:37
which or which are closer would be more
49:40
practical for the company to utilize so
49:43
we're actively trying to help find the
49:46
resources they need to keep going Thank
49:51
You governor thanks for coming up and
49:52
holding this meeting a lot of things
49:55
that was said I was gonna say but I have
49:57
a couple of questions if you just give
49:58
me a couple of minutes first of all are
50:01
these jobs can be union jobs are they
50:03
going to be represented by your steel
50:06
workers associate union or whoever yeah
50:08
are these going to be union jobs that
50:09
you're going to be providing well you're
50:12
leaping ahead a little bit the only jobs
50:13
we've talked to the unions about so far
50:15
been the construction jobs on-site which
50:16
I think have been predominantly union in
50:18
the in the past right I don't see that
50:20
changing I don't I think we have a
50:23
pre-existing contract that was in place
50:25
before the bankruptcies and and and and
50:29
that has to be probably reinstated so
50:30
their first jobs are the construction
50:32
jobs now long-term I know there are
50:35
Union and non-union operations up here I
50:38
haven't spent one minute looking at
50:41
what's gonna happen there but I'm I
50:42
don't see why these would go one way or
50:45
the other I mean I think we we just have
50:47
to get good at that and figure it out as
50:48
we move forward and start looking at
50:50
operations okay I just want to say
50:52
cliffs jobs are union jobs okay so it's
50:56
Northshore Union
50:57
no I'm saying united taconite where I
51:01
represent the place I represent you're
51:03
not attacking these Union jobs
51:04
okay that's what I asked some are and
51:07
some aren't well that's right okay okay
51:09
that was my question my second question
51:10
is the Commissioner land war you know a
51:13
couple of things first of all you know
51:15
you made a comment that I thought was
51:17
very poignant and that is that we could
51:23
have stopped set the clock back and done
51:27
this over again did the state have the
51:31
opportunity to revoke the leases prior
51:35
to the bankruptcy so the it could can
51:43
terminate leases when the lease
51:45
conditions are not being met and in the
51:47
case of SR you know we we kept going as
51:50
long as we thought it was reasonable to
51:51
go forward ultimately realize that this
51:53
was going nowhere and we filed to
51:55
terminate the leases they filed for
51:57
bankruptcy but the day of that
51:59
termination so that bankruptcy
52:01
proceedings preempted our our
52:04
determination so that leases went into
52:07
the bankruptcy proceedings yeah I find
52:09
that I find that it's unfortunate that
52:10
that occurred so the other question I
52:12
have is for the general purposes of
52:16
cliffs resources okay I met with inland
52:20
steel representatives last week I've met
52:22
with Lorenzen gonzalvez a CEO cliffs
52:24
we've had a really good working
52:26
relationship I have the trust and faith
52:28
in him I don't know anything about your
52:30
company we sit easily with all due
52:31
respect but I'm telling you I know
52:33
cliffs resources I've worked with them
52:35
on a regular basis and I know that and
52:38
many of these mining experts tell me as
52:42
a layperson as the mayor Virginian
52:43
elected officials whatever that case may
52:46
be this is what they tell me you got to
52:48
have the product you got to have the
52:51
expertise and you have to have the the
52:53
the the finances to make this project
52:57
come to fruition you have to have the
52:59
opportunity to provide jobs for your
53:02
personnel you have to have the track
53:04
record and I'm telling you that cliffs
53:05
resources has his track record and so I
53:08
stand by cliffs resources i side the
53:10
letter to go
53:11
as part of the range mirrors association
53:14
through rams and i think that that's
53:16
where I stand I stand for what I believe
53:19
in and I believe cliffs resources should
53:21
have the opportunity or should have had
53:23
the opportunity before to mine these
53:24
projects so the SRS coming in you got
53:27
Tom Clark had all those kind of things
53:30
he went off spent all those millions and
53:32
millions of dollars and if cliffs would
53:34
have had that opportunity before if we
53:37
were able to terminate those leases
53:38
prior to that we had to wait six years
53:41
they would have put that mine together
53:43
and we had been offering I was just
53:53
gonna say it and to be clear you know
53:54
cliffs had the opportunity to acquire
53:56
this in bankruptcy as well and so
53:58
they've had every opportunity along the
53:59
way that anybody else has had to acquire
54:01
these mineral rights and he's and he's
54:04
uh and his permit to mine cliffs didn't
54:07
take an opportunity and we had real
54:08
money on the table unlike the other
54:10
property that's trying to run this right
54:12
now I've got a question for you mr.
54:14
Hayes Lee how how much reserve do you
54:18
have in that current permitted pit when
54:23
you look at the permit area how much
54:26
reserve do you have in that permitted
54:27
pit I can tell you if you want but how
54:29
much do you have in there how much you
54:30
think we have you have ten years
54:32
twenty-five percent of which is
54:33
controlled by cliffs and that's at your
54:35
nameplate production rate you just said
54:38
that you're gonna run this place for
54:39
decades and decades how are you going to
54:42
do that well I'm not gonna run it for
54:44
decades and decades right this is gonna
54:45
outlast all of us how is your company
54:47
gonna run it for decades and decades
54:49
well you know as well as anybody that
54:52
when these kinds of investments are made
54:54
they run for many many years so we've
54:57
got a mining plan we've got permits in
54:59
place how you're asking me to answer a
55:02
question for twenty years for now tell
55:04
you what with what with what reserve
55:06
I'll ask it differently with what
55:08
reserve well we've got a mine plan it's
55:12
permitted if you want to get into the
55:14
twenty year plans III can't do I want to
55:16
get into the ten year plan of which you
55:19
have seven and a half years on a billion
55:22
dollar investment all right you know
55:24
it's an
55:24
in question bill you want to jump in on
55:26
this you spend far more time than I so
55:43
this area has more than ten years how
55:47
many ball it has 14 at least how many
55:50
tons
55:51
krutov that's a 7 million tons of
55:54
pellets yes
55:57
21 for 50 million tons of crude per year
56:01
right how many tons do you have in there
56:04
I told you that we had 14 you have 240
56:08
million tons in there 240 million tons
56:13
there's a 2 billion ton resource there
56:16
you have 240 million tons permitted when
56:19
waiting six years for that governor I
56:22
have a question for you as Cleveland
56:25
cliffs ever burned you know they have no
56:31
they haven't burned me I think they have
56:32
spread a lot of misinformation about the
56:34
current situation
56:35
what misinformation that you we can just
56:38
pick this thing up and hand it over to
56:39
them tomorrow that's not true
56:42
I did we didn't ask to be handed it
56:44
tomorrow we wanted two years ago if we
56:46
had tearsa going to be four years open
56:48
and go into bankruptcy who had other
56:50
options
56:50
you guys still made a decision coming
56:53
out of bankruptcy to handle lease back
56:55
to Mesabi metallics correct no lease
56:58
what was all of that leases went into
57:01
bankruptcy as part of the package a part
57:02
of the deal whose owner was Sr would
57:05
filed for bankruptcy and that sudden
57:07
suddenly in the hands of a federal judge
57:09
under federal law and we didn't have the
57:12
right at that point to take those leases
57:14
back well then what were all those
57:16
stipulations for that they had to meet
57:17
after they came after the judge awarded
57:20
to Chippewa then they had stipulations
57:23
which you said they met even though they
57:26
didn't meet them right I said that is
57:30
something we have to go to court trying
57:32
to prove I have doubts on my own mind I
57:34
wish it was I was frustrated is anybody
57:37
else here I wish
57:38
a clear-cut I was the ownership work
57:40
clerk up I would say are underway full
57:42
bore construction tomorrow but they're
57:44
not you know I all the questions and
57:47
criticism about the current situation
57:48
are absolutely valid but the question is
57:52
what is the alternative well so in six
57:54
years when Mesabi metallics is not
57:57
running this they've run back to
57:58
wherever country they came from where
58:01
how much money is the state going to
58:03
have made on this so you suck at making
58:06
money right thank you so
58:10
[Applause]
58:18
well that's not completely correct the
58:20
state will get royalties even if they
58:22
have not constructed the plant that's
58:24
part of what I was mentioning before so
58:30
summarizing what I'm hearing and this is
58:33
really interesting to hear because I
58:34
have not been exposed your thinking
58:36
before but you got to recognize that
58:38
you've got a couple of complaints then
58:39
one is it you'd like a different
58:40
corporation to own the project okay I
58:44
mean it's your employer and you'd like
58:45
your employer to grow no one took it
58:49
from them right there have been multiple
58:51
opportunities to invest cliffs is a
58:54
great company with plenty of resources
58:55
and could have done that at any time
58:57
over the last 30 years I don't know why
59:00
they didn't and it is what it is you
59:04
want the project to last for many
59:06
decades right or more than 20 years or
59:08
whatever you're you're saying but you
59:10
don't want it to operate right it's got
59:13
to go one way or the other so I I
59:18
understand that you would like your
59:19
company to own it I don't know why your
59:21
company didn't buy it and I can't deal
59:22
with any of that that's history right
59:24
the mission now is very simple let's
59:27
build this project start mining and
59:29
create some jobs and from your
59:31
perspective then if it doesn't work in
59:33
six years
59:34
apparently you wouldn't care right so so
59:38
I don't so the hostility and the passion
59:40
I understand better now but I think it
59:44
may be misplaced look here's the bottom
59:46
line let's get this thing built right
59:48
let's get in the market and go right
59:55
well back back the whole story here
59:58
first question is where Town Hall
60:01
Cleveland Cliffs owns our area of this
60:05
property where is their representative
60:08
to the board up here right now this town
60:10
hall meeting is this not about Cleveland
60:13
clips to or not not about us at all well
60:19
well what we came here tonight to talk
60:21
about was the Mesabi metallics plan and
60:23
show you the Mesabi metallics ownership
60:25
and and by virtue of the ownership they
60:28
have a majority
60:29
ownership in the pit okay
60:33
Cleveland clips also asked the DNR to
60:36
remove or remove myself italics from the
60:41
area at least and the DNR has not
60:43
responded back to them what is the
60:45
status on that well there's kind of a
60:48
couple questions there was we cannot
60:52
remove Mesabi metallics from the lease
60:53
okay I think you just said that rule was
60:56
highly metallics from the property and
60:58
the lease
60:58
Masoli metallics owns 50% of the area in
61:04
yellow in Cleveland cliffs or cliffs
61:06
owns the other 50% that's their
61:09
ownership they all know we cannot remove
61:11
them from that owner Phil used I'm sorry
61:13
the portions that are 50/50 least that's
61:16
the yellow area on the map that's the
61:18
50-50 lease that means that 50% is owned
61:20
by cliffs mr. stone is owned by Miss Ida
61:22
metallics under state law that gives
61:25
them the right to go before a judge and
61:27
get the right to mine it and then to
61:29
share the profits back with a second
61:30
owner we don't have any authority over
61:32
whether or not they have that right they
61:39
correct and the the blue much of the
61:43
blue is the state lease some of that is
61:46
there's private lease in there as well
61:47
but that's a hundred percent controlled
61:48
by masonic italics right now the red is
61:51
that area which is 100% controlled by
61:54
cliffs but again that is in litigation
61:57
right now with the district court third
62:00
question is about us W standing mister
62:03
or mr. Tom Clark signed an agreement
62:06
with us W to create us W jobs I'm asking
62:10
you right now no questions asked yes or
62:13
no are those jobs at whatever mine
62:17
becomes of it gonna be us W so that
62:20
would answer your own yes or no so I
62:22
think what Tom Clark signed I believe
62:24
was a new trial it doesn't know I said
62:26
no dancing around yes or no I'm not
62:28
dancing I'll give you a straight answer
62:30
right that's what I do right
62:33
I think what Tom Clark signed is a
62:35
neutrality agreement correct all right
62:37
so you know what happens after that
62:38
right then a project is built people are
62:41
hired and there's
62:42
and or questions that are you gonna
62:44
solve that a neutrality agreement that
62:46
Tom Stark signed
62:47
sure I don't think there's it's that's
62:49
not optional right that's in there and
62:51
and you know by way of history I've done
62:54
some work with unions in the past and
62:55
had some pretty good outcomes I mean if
62:58
you look again when the industry was
63:00
really on its back the Union was one of
63:02
the key groups that helped bring it back
63:04
back to life if you look at what they
63:06
did and the way they came at those those
63:09
challenging times they were just a
63:11
critical element of saving the industry
63:12
so I've got no beef with the Union right
63:15
but yeah agreements been signed and that
63:18
neutrality agreement and now we've got
63:21
to move forward
63:21
correct okay we're just making sure
63:24
that's still in effect may I just add
63:27
one thing an answer to the gentleman's
63:29
question because something that's been
63:30
misreported several times which is that
63:33
the Department of Natural Resources has
63:35
not responded to Cleveland cliffs
63:38
requests for a permit transfer so
63:43
Cleveland cliffs has asked us to do one
63:44
of three things with the existing permit
63:47
to mine either transfer it terminate it
63:52
or modify it we've looked at statute and
63:58
rule we cannot either terminate that
64:04
agreement or transfer it on the request
64:09
of a party who is not on the permit and
64:14
we have in fact on two occasions
64:17
communicated that back to the company to
64:19
Cleveland cliffs we can modify the
64:24
permit if needed in order to reflect
64:27
changes on the ground with the permit
64:31
holder Mesabi metallics and we have
64:33
indicated that we will look at that and
64:35
make the changes that may be necessary
64:38
based on changed real-estate control in
64:41
the area that is not a short or a simple
64:44
process but that is something we have
64:46
said we will look at
64:49
yes I'm John Johnson I have a question
64:53
for mr. peasley and then I have a just a
64:56
few comments I'd like to make first of
64:59
all what does the Saba metallic
65:01
experience in taconite mining and to
65:06
would you be willing to sell it to close
65:08
took lives the property so Mesabi
65:13
metallics is a start-up company right so
65:15
you know what that means
65:16
there's a tremendous amount of knowledge
65:19
on this iron rain iron range there are
65:21
decades and decades of history so yeah
65:23
in our in our team our core team we have
65:26
a huge amount of knowledge of everything
65:28
from construction to environmental to
65:30
safety on into operating mines we've got
65:34
a lot of depth there to really create
65:36
this as a new company we're gonna be
65:39
hiring more and more people over time so
65:42
you know as this project moves forward
65:44
we will build that team that will then
65:47
be able to drive this company in the
65:49
future so that's the answer on on that
65:51
question yet I'm sorry what was your
65:53
second question and would you be willing
65:55
to sell your rights to clips well two
65:59
things there one is you know I again I
66:01
don't know why cliffs has never really
66:03
you know since like the mid-80s and
66:06
given their presence in the region I
66:07
don't have any idea why they haven't
66:09
done this so that's not a discussion
66:12
that's going on now we aren't talking to
66:13
a new investor that new investor has an
66:15
exclusivity we're gonna move forward
66:17
with them and I think cliffs has made it
66:19
pretty clear they have no interest in
66:20
playing any role with this company so I
66:22
I just you know I don't have the history
66:25
I'm just here to try to push this thing
66:27
forward so yeah I guess my comment is is
66:30
that you know I've got a lifelong Ranger
66:32
here I've worked 39 years at Hidden
66:35
taconite and I and I've seen over the
66:38
years you know we've had all these
66:39
promises of endotronix and chopsticks
66:42
factories and and they start they're
66:45
going to have this mill here and we are
66:47
going to have a direct reduction mill
66:50
you know
66:51
in a steel mill and all we know don't -
66:54
ten years later all we have is another
66:57
taconite mind and well we got a
66:59
perfectly good tack and I mind you know
67:02
15 miles north the air that would love
67:04
to have this or you know so I guess you
67:08
know looking back I think back about
67:11
cliffs you know why they didn't buy this
67:13
20 years ago they had deep pockets they
67:16
bought coal mines they bought Canadian
67:18
mines they bought Australian mines and
67:21
they all went bust and now mr. Conclave
67:25
has finally saw the light and he starts
67:28
gonna invest in the people that are you
67:31
know make the money around here you know
67:33
and so and I I applaud him for getting
67:38
rid of all of that stuff and now he's
67:40
made a commitment to keep the North
67:43
American steel industry of life and he's
67:46
that he's demonstrated that time and
67:48
time and time again with the with the
67:51
nagas mine in Ohio which we could have
67:54
had you know and now we're here again
67:59
waiting for this thing to get going you
68:03
know and it's just it's just dragging on
68:05
it seems like you and cliffs both have
68:09
some skin in this game you know and so
68:12
either you guys should either partner up
68:15
and let's get this baby going or and
68:17
then the other thing of it is what's
68:19
gonna happen to having taconite you know
68:21
they've got a short amount of ore left
68:24
you know all you're gonna do is close on
68:26
hitting tagging eight and create a new
68:28
taconite company you know those there's
68:31
800 jobs there that are gonna be lost so
68:35
those are my comments and and my concern
68:38
so I thank you for listening thank
68:45
governor I'm Harlan tardy I'm a lifelong
68:47
resident I grew up right on this spot I
68:50
played baseball hockey right here in
68:53
Cloverdale
68:53
and I spent my entire life here at 33
68:56
years as a school board member at Nashua
68:58
Keewatin I was there when Butler closed
69:01
in the mid 80s and we lost
69:02
our student population virtually
69:05
overnight and the nightmares that came
69:07
with that I'm a I'm a strong supporter
69:10
of the Iron Range I've been in community
69:13
service supporting the entire Iron Range
69:15
all my life and and there's a lot of
69:18
stake here there's a lot of a lot of
69:20
compassion as we've all heard you know
69:22
I'm not trying to jump on the bandwagon
69:24
either way but but has a shortage of or
69:31
is there anything on all of branch that
69:34
can come out of this night governor I'm
69:37
asking you where we can I know the
69:40
permitting I know the bureaucracy I've
69:42
been in state government trying to solve
69:46
problems to better serve the people of
69:49
the Iron Range is there any olive branch
69:52
that can be handed out for these
69:53
permitting processes you know what we're
69:56
tacking light was there all those years
69:58
had the permits ten years ago they come
70:02
in and they have they got the permits
70:04
the permits are there and all the same
70:05
land that that that Cleveland Cliffs is
70:08
looking at has all been permitted before
70:10
I just don't understand why the
70:13
bureaucracy is such so tough that they
70:17
can't cut those seven eight years down
70:19
because we all know the market will
70:21
change it's cyclical or the mining
70:24
industry I've been around here and seen
70:26
it suffer a year after year after year
70:28
of I see my father my brother my sons
70:31
I've watched them all come through that
70:33
system and we're not even looking at a
70:38
at the end of this I mean if another
70:42
pellet plant is only gonna in the market
70:45
now might be fine but I didn't even hear
70:47
a commitment goes to where those pellets
70:49
would go they're gonna go on the market
70:50
I gotta go on the market they're going
70:52
to compete with everything that key tech
70:55
UTech cliffs compete cliffs needs or is
71:01
there anything possible that you can
71:03
work on to try to cut that permitting
71:07
process down and throw an olive branch
71:09
out there and let them let metallics do
71:12
their
71:13
well I can't I can't boy I'm just
71:17
frustrated he is well probably not as
71:19
far says any of you that Center I don't
71:22
live here but I was able with repurposed
71:24
Joe and Butler shut down and walked into
71:26
the high school auditorium with 500
71:29
people hoping and praying that he could
71:31
come up with something
71:32
do the same with Paul Wellstone LTV
71:34
these are very real and affect people's
71:37
lives drastically to keep this industry
71:39
going keep what we have now is you got
71:42
to be number one priority if it's the
71:46
intent is to take the resources that are
71:48
part of the mineral leases there and and
71:52
use those as a source additional source
71:55
of lore for for having taconite then I
71:59
mean that's what I've always believed is
72:01
what cliffs really has in mind that's
72:05
you know that's one way to go with it
72:06
it's not in our power right now to
72:08
convert that because Mesabi owns the
72:11
project that exists and they have their
72:14
saying they want to go ahead with it but
72:15
you know that's a that's a valid plan B
72:18
if we had gone before they filed for
72:22
bankruptcy we would have had the
72:23
discretion to make some of those
72:26
decisions
72:28
s-sir one of the other ways that you
72:30
know I won't forgive s therefore a lot
72:32
of things lying to my face on a Skype
72:35
call for one but when they jump we gave
72:38
proper notices we had to do legally
72:40
about our intent to withdraw leases and
72:42
they jumped into bankruptcy
72:44
it shows what sleazy operators they've
72:46
been all along yes but yet their
72:48
potential partner or money-wise you know
72:55
that was it and I don't know what the
72:59
backroom deal is I'm told they or they
73:02
might want to buy their creditors out
73:05
there are other creditors who are owed I
73:07
don't know hundreds of millions of
73:08
dollars of debt
73:09
I'm told they want to buy that some of
73:11
that debt from those creditors and a
73:13
discount rate and then hope when the
73:15
project sixties they'll get repaid
73:18
they're not gonna operate you say that
73:21
we're my dead body they'll up they won't
73:23
operate and
73:24
you know but the financial part of this
73:27
is out in a different stratosphere but
73:31
if they're gonna put whoever's gonna
73:32
make it happen financially is as long as
73:36
they stay out of the operation I won't
73:37
believe or this governor I thank you for
73:39
coming and being before us but this was
73:43
mining land for 100 years
73:45
this is Butler this was old Hanna mining
73:47
this was the history there the entire
73:50
area is mining land it has been
73:53
permitted over and over and over a bitch
73:55
a gazillion times it's been looked at
73:57
I just don't my view understand why it
74:03
just has to be partial doubt so
74:05
metallics can get the whole say so in
74:08
the end the job this other land is just
74:11
as important to can't keeping and
74:14
maintaining these other jobs just over
74:17
to over here to the east that those jobs
74:21
and those jobs are going to go away when
74:23
that and that or runs out unless there's
74:27
you know I know and again I'm not privy
74:39
to negotiations between cliffs and
74:42
Mesabi minute Alex I know with her Clark
74:44
he said he wanted was willing to share
74:47
that 50/50 ownership the yellow open
74:49
arts there whether they could work out
74:51
that cliffs owns 50 the rights of 50
74:54
percent of that and I don't know how
74:57
much of that of the total of the
74:59
positives is in those lands the map that
75:02
shows where's the larger map that is all
75:04
the in Orange there that shows that what
75:06
cliffs owns again if they want to mine
75:10
that they can apply for a permit to mine
75:14
no they just for a permit to mine
75:18
well I'm sorry that's what state law
75:20
requires you know well two things if I
75:23
could add to that one is that as I
75:26
mentioned we are working with hip tack
75:28
on finding additional resources both on
75:30
state land and they've got some private
75:32
leases or some private mineral rights as
75:34
well that they may have some access to
75:35
them we're hopeful with that but I think
75:50
they go you better talk to your staff
75:54
we've got a few people working on some
75:57
some small areas that we needed a big
75:59
area for hip tack we've got we've got
76:02
five years left q1 of 2025 that property
76:06
is is o2 or and in ninety day hundred
76:10
and twenty days extensions aren't gonna
76:13
do it any good
76:14
we need something significant there and
76:16
I think we're working with our saloon US
76:19
Steel yeah that's that's who you're
76:20
working for so let's tackle it and I
76:25
believe it is what cliffs wants to
76:27
legitimately so is to have the access to
76:30
that body of or their complete for not
76:34
for ability as a son of SR plant but to
76:38
transfer to Hibbing tack
76:40
that's that should be on the table it
76:45
secondly to your earlier point if if a
76:48
company comes in with an amendment to a
76:50
permit to mine that expands the mine
76:53
existing mine operation that is a much
76:55
shorter process than a
76:56
brand-spankin'-new permit to mine so
76:58
there are options for companies to get
77:00
access to or faster than a six or seven
77:04
year process and a permit to mine I have
77:07
just one question to expand on the
77:08
question about about the business model
77:11
here and you're talking about not having
77:14
a blast furnace ready to take these
77:16
pellets you don't have a customer and
77:18
I've been involved with with shipping
77:19
org through the Great Lakes trying to
77:21
ship them to to overseas and the expense
77:24
of that when times are really good its
77:27
effective when it's five or six million
77:29
tons of additional pellets come on the
77:30
market
77:31
rating all the iron ore balanced attack
77:33
and appellate balance in the blast
77:35
furnace that that is well well developed
77:37
right now and there isn't any margin on
77:40
either side ArcelorMittal our therm
77:42
Mattel us steel and cliffs that's very
77:46
very well imbalance in the states I'd
77:49
like to know who really you plan on
77:51
selling pellets to when the market is
77:53
hot as it is now you may be able to make
77:55
a small margin otherwise you're
77:57
depleting the resources in Minnesota
77:59
shipping these pellets overseas to an
78:01
offshore company and and we still the
78:04
margin would be so small I don't know
78:06
how you would possibly invest in this
78:08
project without just bring an additional
78:10
iron ore into the US market that's not
78:12
needed right now
78:15
[Applause]
78:22
hi my name is Katherine Lee and I'm from
78:24
Buell I was one of those people that
78:26
went away a long time ago and I'm kind
78:29
of back my question is for for you at
78:33
Mesabi metallica if you'd be willing to
78:35
share that information with us
78:37
what is your operating capital right now
78:41
so you realize where we're not in
78:43
operations right so I'm not exactly sure
78:45
what you're specifically asking I'm not
78:47
in operate okay okay we're we're we sort
78:49
out we're right now in a different sorry
78:52
what is your debt load right now as a
78:53
company so to your point this is a
78:57
private business and we don't disclose
78:59
all these things there's some debt that
79:00
came out of the bankruptcy okay some of
79:02
that was the result of negotiations with
79:06
prepetition creditors
79:07
right I think that's known to be about
79:08
300 million okay and then there was some
79:12
some other prepetition exposures for
79:17
what you'd call mechanic's liens or I
79:18
feel that mechanic's liens done work
79:20
on-site and those have all been paid
79:22
okay what amount are you looking to
79:26
raise and where I realize you have you
79:28
said that you have an exclusive I
79:30
believe the reports up here is that it's
79:33
with Sigma Surya or SR steel so it's the
79:38
name of the companies mercury ax like
79:39
Korea all right and they began looking
79:41
at the credit facility coming in that
79:44
way and then came in and said we'd
79:45
rather buy equity so that's what they're
79:47
doing now is looking at how to play in
79:49
that and make sure they make the best
79:51
move and how much would it be to
79:54
actually get your project up running
79:55
well you know I so I I'm not I can't
79:59
talk about what mercury is doing right
80:00
now and what their numbers animate but
80:02
if you look at the credit facility
80:04
that's a 650 million dollar facility
80:05
okay would we be in a position where we
80:08
would have appear a facility that is
80:11
ready to be run with 650 billion dollars
80:15
worth of equity investment it's not
80:18
equity that would be dead the equity
80:21
that's brought out was a little over 200
80:22
no no so there's a credit facility right
80:26
this is the the credit facility was
80:28
signed at the end of June I think that's
80:30
been widely discussed publicly as being
80:32
a 650 million dollar facility the
80:35
woody peas that has come in so far it's
80:37
more is in excess of 200 million right
80:40
there's more equity coming in right
80:42
there's some more equity to bring in but
80:44
you know you got to look at all then so
80:47
to your point right I think your real
80:49
point is you have these nice together is
80:52
the plan intact
80:53
so you know looking at the budgets that
80:56
we have now the project is sufficiently
80:59
capitalized to move forward now we've
81:00
got to do all the right things we've got
81:02
a lot of work left to do so you know
81:04
we'll tell you more is we've got as
81:07
frankly as I've been in this deeper and
81:09
we've gotten through some of the more
81:10
detailed work that has to be completed
81:11
and we'll come back and talk again okay
81:14
governor Dayton you mentioned that you
81:17
didn't have a very nice Skype
81:19
conversation with the people from SR and
81:22
I really appreciate your frankness and
81:24
your honesty in that because I think all
81:26
of us sitting in this room pretty much
81:28
wondered what was going on and I am
81:32
somebody who did a lot of work
81:33
internationally and there's one country
81:37
and there was one firm that keeps coming
81:38
up time and again in this whole thing
81:41
and I'm just wanting to ask are we aware
81:43
of this or is this even important
81:47
McCrea recently has gone before I
81:50
believe it was within the last year to
81:53
do a deal with I think it's Venezuela to
81:57
buy out some project that the Russians
82:00
invested in several billions of dollars
82:03
and I'm just wondering I know they were
82:06
invested you know throughout the United
82:08
States and that so that might not be a
82:10
big issue but that is through a company
82:13
that has been sanctioned and I just
82:15
wonder if you're aware of if they've
82:17
gotten their approval on that and then
82:19
secondly also SR steel although they
82:21
have no connections necessarily with
82:23
Russia s our oil does they're in a joint
82:27
venture with that same company Rosneft
82:29
and in fact after after there was all
82:33
these problems up here Russia went into
82:36
a really nice deal with their Indians
82:37
and with us our two by a large portion
82:41
of their oil company because they're
82:43
holding is doing so poorly at the time
82:45
so I guess I'm just wondering are you
82:46
aware in the due diligence I suppose you
82:49
can't talk about it but the McCrea deal
82:52
where do they stand with their approval
82:54
because they won't be able to invest
82:56
necessarily well mr. Dayton if they
82:59
don't get any type of approval from that
83:01
and you know where does that stand I
83:03
guess here in Minnesota for this project
83:06
is that a big obstacle those are very
83:08
good questions I don't I don't have the
83:10
answer you know a lot more about the
83:11
International money markets than I do
83:14
you know Tom you got a project here that
83:18
was half built then left and you're
83:20
trying to get people to finance is
83:22
moving forward I know that Tom Clark
83:26
tried to get the mention Chase Manhattan
83:27
he mentioned a couple other Wall Street
83:30
firms as people he had gone to was
83:32
hopeful they might make the investment
83:35
and also issue the debt and I I'm just
83:38
guessing here but Marion law is that
83:40
they declined to do so so you know I I
83:45
mean I think whoever was trying to move
83:48
this forward is was has been forced to
83:51
move into international money markets
83:52
which is a whole complexity that beyond
83:55
what I understand but you know if the
83:59
financing is there and that's cash is
84:03
cash and and debt is debt and if those
84:06
are going to go forward I think it's
84:08
less and there's no operating control
84:11
I mean it's early of concern but it's
84:13
like oh who else is there
84:14
and but Korea at this point is not
84:18
bought into the project they're looking
84:21
at they're doing the due diligence you
84:23
know but at this point the owner is
84:26
Dubai and you know I mean I wish it were
84:32
a US bank but you know that's just not
84:36
the option that's available well that's
84:43
what their 650 million
84:47
a representative that they had so a
85:04
couple of things so the company's been
85:08
investing in construction now for about
85:10
15 months so that's been ongoing on the
85:12
site albeit at a relatively low level
85:14
but in critical path investments that
85:16
that are going to be important in moving
85:18
the project forward so it makes sense
85:20
right the 200 million that they've
85:22
invested again some of it went to pre
85:24
petition claims and things that really
85:26
had to do with the past and not so much
85:28
the future but it was important that
85:30
they put hundreds of millions of dollars
85:31
and over these years I know it's been
85:34
painful but they've put hundreds of
85:36
millions of dollars into local economy
85:37
which I'm quite certain has benefited
85:39
everybody had to right now going forward
85:42
that 650 is a credit facility right so
85:46
so you know we can talk more about that
85:48
later but you look at how credit
85:49
facilities work and you've got to do
85:51
some things that and access them and
85:52
then you set it up so there's been there
85:54
has been steady construction on site for
85:56
some time
86:15
so so the the deadlines that are out
86:19
there I'm aware of these deadlines you
86:21
know we're looking at them the key that
86:25
I'm focused on right now not necessarily
86:27
no I mean there are penalties if the
86:30
project isn't in place by the end of
86:32
2018 making pellets there are penalties
86:34
financial penalties associated with that
86:36
I know that benefits the state a little
86:39
bit right but the real goal here is to
86:41
get this thing up and running so you
86:43
know we'll check in later with you and
86:45
we are really will continue to talk
86:49
about the schedule going forward so you
86:50
can keep it a little bit that's your
86:51
concern well there has been a lot of
87:02
work done on this it's there's actually
87:04
permits are in place all the permits are
87:10
for an hyl product I use well hyl
87:13
facility if you I'm sure you're aware
87:16
that right yeah yeah okay I've got a
87:24
question for there your business or your
87:33
company out there that you're making and
87:36
your building now all this metal that's
87:39
come from SR has been proven substandard
87:43
so as a concerned person for safety the
87:50
bolts that they brought in have snapped
87:53
all right the iron workers have said the
87:55
bolts are substandard so now we're gonna
87:57
go and build this project with all this
88:00
junk metal that came from SR India okay
88:05
so what is the guarantee we have for
88:07
safety of the people that are gonna be
88:09
working there so you know I I haven't
88:12
seen any bolts snapping right but I can
88:14
tell you that as you know in
88:15
construction there's a lot of quality
88:17
assurance and quality control processes
88:18
that are put in place so these will be
88:21
you know looked at nobody's going to be
88:23
building
88:23
was substandard well there there the
88:26
person that was inspecting that was was
88:29
from SR and he just went wrote it off no
88:32
no problems no problem no problem so I
88:35
think that we should really have a look
88:37
at what that building is gonna be like
88:40
for the people okay I know the stairways
88:43
aren't up to code
88:44
already I know that that's very good
88:49
very good advice and I suppose he'll
88:51
take another did somebody we can trust
88:54
to do that kind of inspection absolutely
88:57
right safety comes first my question is
89:01
for Gary easily I've been following the
89:03
bankruptcy through ESR when I look on
89:07
there on the dockets it always says s
89:09
are a KA Mesabi metallics why did they
89:13
change their name to Mesabi metallics
89:15
that's my first question they didn't get
89:18
bought up by Mesabi that got renamed and
89:20
my question is why yeah I have not
89:23
followed the dockets like that I wasn't
89:24
around for the bankruptcy I don't know
89:26
you know the way this works a company
89:29
called Chippewa was formed Chippewa
89:30
actually owns Mesabi metallics that's
89:33
the way it's organized so I'm not sure
89:35
if you if you have a specific docket
89:37
send it to me I'll read it it's in
89:39
bankruptcy court it's all over it's
89:40
every every every docket that Salter
89:43
says sr a KA Masami metallics why did
89:46
they change your name that's my question
89:48
why change it from SR to Mesabi
89:50
metallics yeah I don't know about named
89:51
J I really don't have the history and
89:53
truth be told I haven't spent any time
89:55
going back and reading all of this the
89:57
whole bankruptcy docket is you know
89:58
those will be thousands of pages we're
90:00
really looking much more in the future
90:02
and how to move forward so if you've got
90:04
something specific you want me to read
90:05
and you send it it I'll try to take a
90:07
look at it well in those doc it's sr a
90:10
Kemosabe metallics had the opportunity
90:14
to pay for Glacier Park leases and land
90:19
and they didn't if they were serious
90:22
about this property to me that that was
90:24
less money than they paid the
90:25
contractors I don't understand why they
90:27
didn't pay that
90:28
that's why cliffs has it today so can
90:31
you tell me why they did not pay Glacier
90:32
Park no I think that all predates my
90:35
involvement I'm not sure
90:36
you know I know that they had
90:39
obligations to pay the creditors and
90:40
they've made payments and the rest of it
90:42
its history I don't know
90:44
my my name is Jesse Dunsmore I'm al and
90:47
professional with Cleveland Cliffs my
90:49
questions for commissioner land we're on
90:52
2016 the state gave advance notice of
90:55
termination 2s are allowing SR to file
90:57
bankruptcy and tie the leases up during
91:01
the bankruptcy the other major landowner
91:04
Glacier Park they successfully extracted
91:06
themselves and monetize their land with
91:09
a credible party with cliffs when I
91:12
listen to everyone tonight and the
91:13
questions and in the line of answers my
91:17
analysis is the projects going to go
91:18
bankrupt again and I'm I'm good at being
91:21
objective I can take a step back and I
91:23
can look at it and the reasons why I say
91:26
that is one there's no real customer if
91:28
you're actually targeting eaf so you
91:29
don't really need a Swiss commodity
91:31
trader to drive down to Ohio or in
91:33
Indiana and talk to the EAS there's no
91:35
real financing it's a it's a credit line
91:39
that you know yeah you just said there's
91:42
strings attached they don't really have
91:43
the money in the bank you know the team
91:46
is small you need a huge team to pull
91:49
off a project like this they lost
91:51
control their property 50 percent of the
91:53
resource they lost control of they lost
91:56
control significant lands they needed
91:57
for permits lost control of critical
92:00
infrastructure for the project there
92:03
been four different CEOs in three years
92:04
by my count but I'm starting to lose
92:06
track the the plans change all the time
92:09
and they don't really make sense they're
92:11
moving they're building this then
92:13
they're building that and they're going
92:14
down to Indiana and back and you know
92:18
and there's been little to no progress
92:19
you know I've monitored construction and
92:22
it's you know a couple guys go out
92:23
looking for a beam and it takes them
92:25
forever because nothing's labeled
92:26
there's no plans they pick up the beam
92:28
they haul to the crane they lift it up
92:29
they put one beam in place and they move
92:31
on to the next beam it's one beam at a
92:33
time right now and if they had the money
92:34
and they needed to be done by 2019
92:36
they'd be moving the equipment's been
92:39
sitting out too long it's junk now so
92:41
when you look through that list you go
92:42
if I'm a lessor if I'm the state I want
92:45
to rent my property to someone that's
92:46
good that's going to pull off the
92:47
project gonna pay the bills and you look
92:50
down that list
92:50
that's nama sabi metallics and so so my
92:54
question is you know when you're doing
92:56
your analysis on who you're gonna lease
92:57
to when you're gonna face that reality
92:59
that you know even if it's going to take
93:02
longer the best path is to move on to a
93:04
credible party instead of a startup
93:06
company where they said they're still
93:07
trying to build the company just tonight
93:09
and then to when you finally face that
93:12
reality that it's going to go bankrupt
93:14
and you're better off finding a good
93:15
credible party that's got them that has
93:17
the money has the markets how are you
93:20
going to prevent the leases from being
93:22
tied up in bankruptcy again the same
93:23
move pulled on you again
93:27
[Applause]
93:34
let me let me go to the last question
93:36
first and how we're going to prevent the
93:38
leases from going into bankruptcy we
93:39
have we have shielded the leases so that
93:42
they are they are not going to go into
93:43
bankruptcy if the company goes bankrupt
93:44
this time we have a way to get out of
93:47
that again the the process for leasing
93:51
is a statutory process that is laid out
93:53
in law we cannot violate that I mean
93:56
that protects in this case massage we
93:58
might telex but it protects cliffs as
94:00
well from us doing you know ad hoc
94:02
things to leases the people have some
94:04
expectation they're gonna have for long
94:06
period of time so there's a very
94:08
deliberate prescriptive statutory
94:10
process to do leases the Bankruptcy
94:13
Court decided that Mesabi metallics
94:16
should get the leases because they
94:18
looked at what cliffs provided and they
94:19
look at what the savvy metallics
94:21
provided and they said this is where it
94:23
should go we don't have any say over
94:24
that the leases go with the project we
94:45
did not have an opportunity to restrict
94:47
our leases for bankruptcy we made that
94:49
we made the plea to the court that we
94:51
should be able to extract those leases
94:52
from bankruptcy because that we had
94:54
filed for termination of leases there is
95:00
language that the leases would be
95:01
automatically rejected if certain terms
95:03
weren't met and they weren't met what
95:05
extensions were provided to avoid that
95:07
event we we extended the leases while SR
95:12
was still at the head of the project in
95:14
hopes that they would ultimately come to
95:15
to complete the project when it became
95:18
clear they could not we are required to
95:20
give them a notice that the termination
95:22
is coming we're required by statute to
95:25
tell them though your termination is
95:26
coming in 30 days if you don't cure the
95:29
situation here and then we terminate it
95:32
but of course they knew the termination
95:34
was coming they file for bankruptcy
95:35
right before this is just the legal
95:38
process that we can't circumvent
95:41
so you've said that theoretically you
95:43
have rights to terminate the leases at
95:45
this point given that you have doubts
95:46
about the actual financing the actual
95:48
offtake agreements so and then it
95:51
doesn't sound like there's a lot of
95:52
commitment when if obligations aren't
95:55
met in 2019 2018 to actually pull the
95:57
lease is why is that why do I continue
95:59
down the same path what I said is there
96:02
are two conditions that are in our
96:03
leases that allow for us to terminate
96:05
one is if they don't complete
96:06
construction the pillow plant by the end
96:08
of 2019 and the second is if they don't
96:10
ship at least three million tons of
96:11
pellets by 2020 will you extend I'm not
96:16
gonna be here I'm not gonna be here
96:19
either we will and we want to take on
96:22
the project and we want to get it done
96:24
one of you wants to be the commissioner
96:26
apply for the dang job it's great I just
96:43
like to say I've been in this business
96:44
for 43 years I don't have as much
96:46
experience maybe as mr. easily or
96:48
anything aboard pellets or anything
96:49
maybe 75 80 thousand hours I make you
96:52
know I agree with in this era I tend to
96:54
us you know everything he said this guy
96:57
here's a hard act to follow he's got a
96:59
Red Dawn but you know you go back in
97:02
history to like reserve you know cliffs
97:06
bid I reserve and I think safer's obit
97:10
him look all that turned oh here's what
97:13
happened safest came in nine Union old
97:15
fit I don't believe anything that that
97:17
clerk said he was a he was the greatest
97:19
thing that came to mankind here a few
97:22
weeks ago I know he's a bum but he
97:26
signed a piece of paper saying it was
97:28
going to be you and you I'll tell you
97:29
what happened with Cyprus the state
97:32
brought up a non-union company from
97:34
Colorado I think it was it took over
97:36
reserve Oh bid cliffs again because
97:39
flips you know you you're value-added
97:42
video few years later bankrupt cliffs
97:46
takes over you know I think Cyprus
97:51
invested like 34 million
97:53
and they eventually think work like
97:54
these guys are gonna do and cliffs ended
97:57
up with it non-union you know that's
98:02
neither here nor there as far as the
98:03
workers going me any opportunities to go
98:06
a union after that but I'm just saying I
98:08
wouldn't believe anything that that
98:09
clerk promised you know these guys did
98:13
for which I don't think they're gonna
98:15
open up there's no guarantee they're
98:17
gonna be Union to be just like Cypress
98:19
and cliffs didn't rink North Shore
98:22
non-union Cypress it and they were
98:25
brought up just like these guys and your
98:27
cliffs got screwed again and you're
98:30
getting screwed here this time it's just
98:33
a little history lesson I'm you know it
98:35
just seems to me we're gonna repeat this
98:37
right back we're gonna come right back
98:39
or all full circle and we're gonna have
98:41
another reserve another North Shore I
98:44
know it's running and everything but
98:46
these guys are gonna go bankrupt and
98:48
cliffs gonna end up with it the only
98:50
trouble is everybody here in Nash walk
98:52
everything's gonna get screwed because
98:53
it's just gonna take more years more
98:55
time and it's gonna be all drawn out but
98:58
I'll tell you it runs was a guy you know
99:02
he's suing you he's suing I mean a guy
99:04
is we've all said it this man said it
99:06
you said it the guy he has no dummy he's
99:09
not suing for the hell of it he knows
99:11
he's got something he didn't bring
99:12
litigation for no reason at all
99:18
[Applause]
99:22
well I had just had one question to
99:24
follow up on what jesse was saying did
99:26
the governor or did the state and the
99:28
range delegation put a letter into the
99:30
bankruptcy court supporting Mesabi
99:32
metallics in the bid well I think
99:51
senator Thomas Oni is in here too so he
99:53
might remember what you might be talking
99:57
about is when we were in bankruptcy we
100:00
talked with Messiah italics made the the
100:04
bid but before the judge had approved it
100:08
we worked with them on getting better
100:11
lease terms so we got very very good
100:13
lease terms in that final bankruptcy
100:16
proceeding the judge could have ruled in
100:19
the absence of those in which case we
100:21
would not have gotten a better terms but
100:23
because we worked with them ahead of
100:25
time because they agreed to those terms
100:26
the bankruptcy judge took those terms
100:29
and approved that so it was it was it
100:31
was not so much a letter of support but
100:33
it was a list of additional conditions
100:35
that they were willing to agree to
100:36
answer your question I didn't I didn't
100:39
know who mr. Clark was until the
100:41
Bankruptcy Court I don't think anybody
100:43
knew who he was and no and I slowly
100:46
didn't know that he was coming forward
100:47
with it was a bit of it came out as a
100:50
complete surprise so I can say Kenneth
100:52
ethically no we did not write a letter
100:54
to the judge asking that they were to be
100:58
aborted at his Fisher said after they
101:00
were awarded then we waited in the
101:02
things that we wanted to improve in
101:04
terms of the leases
101:14
well I didn't to give them a chance oh
101:18
yeah well I seem to remember that I know
101:21
you guys were trying to pull your leases
101:22
out of court and that went on and and
101:24
that was in support of your agreement
101:26
with cliffs and then something changed
101:28
along that process we're not sure what
101:30
that is but that's what Lorenz was
101:32
talking about when he feels like the gut
101:34
the the state turned around and went a
101:37
different direction from their agreement
101:39
look close so I just want to clarify
101:40
that because I I'm pretty sure I can dig
101:43
that out somewhere because I make a
101:44
habit of keeping an eye on Tom Clark and
101:50
his operation existed till after the
101:52
Bankruptcy Court judge made his decision
101:54
a day or so before but we were not
101:58
involved in that
101:59
I appreciate the response I want to just
102:02
make a comment about the room obviously
102:04
a lot of people have talked about the
102:06
compassion in this room and in
102:08
specifically our employees who are very
102:10
loyal to cliffs and to Lorenzo consol
102:13
base as you know Lorenzo has been up
102:19
here many times over the past six months
102:21
he's the only CEO who was in the room
102:24
when Denis McDonough came up here to
102:27
deal with a steel import crisis he was
102:29
the only CEO of a mining company up here
102:32
who sat at the table with you he knows
102:34
many of the people in this room by your
102:37
names he knows who you are and you all
102:39
know that he contributes generously to
102:43
the communities around here at issue is
102:45
not who bought what who bid it's about
102:48
the agreement between the state and
102:49
Mesabi metallics you showed us the terms
102:52
for that agreement for the state's
102:54
minerals which are owned by the people
102:56
of Minnesota do you honestly governor
103:00
think that Mesabi metallics will
103:02
complete construction of a plant by the
103:05
end of next year I don't know
103:10
you know this is I mean I wish the
103:17
situation were different from what it is
103:19
but it is what it is and so what are the
103:23
what's the state option given that the
103:27
ozone by Mousavi italics they've
103:29
indicated they're going to proceed
103:31
they've got certain conditions they have
103:33
to meet which will take effect you have
103:35
to take place after I left you know if
103:37
they don't if they're if they fail it
103:40
goes into bankruptcy or if it just
103:41
collapses in heat you know then the
103:44
leases are up presumably again for
103:46
somebody to division take those leases
103:48
and use them to feed other their
103:50
operations sure and maybe that's you
103:53
know that's what some people want then
103:54
maybe that's what most people here want
103:56
but that that's not a legal option we
103:59
have right now we can't just say well
104:00
you know we're sorry we're gonna bail
104:02
out of this we didn't make the decision
104:05
Chippewa now Mousavi telex we were not
104:07
involved in that decision the court did
104:10
because they got a two hundred fifty
104:12
million dollar bid and 100 million
104:14
dollar bid and they took the two fifty
104:15
because the other creditors were not
104:17
seat but who had whatever somebody
104:20
estimated 300 million invested they
104:23
they're the ones who had wait with the
104:25
Bankruptcy Court judge because they're
104:27
the ones who had money on the table but
104:29
but if we're talking about where we're
104:32
at right now you know that they're not I
104:35
mean unless a leprechaun lives out in
104:37
Mesabi metallics they're not going to
104:38
have a pellet plant done by the end of
104:40
next year
104:40
and my question is for the people in
104:42
this room do you want the state to give
104:44
this new entity run now by mr. Gary he's
104:47
Lee the time to get it done which is
104:50
going to be an extension governor or is
104:52
it time to take the risk the state to
104:55
take the risk and move on what do you
104:58
think he wants the feedback give him the
105:01
feedback
105:06
hello my name is Annie and I'm not a
105:09
miner and I'm not a lawyer or a lobbyist
105:12
but I do work in the joyful business of
105:14
Education and I serve as elementary
105:17
school principal at Keewatin where lots
105:20
of your kids go to school and this
105:23
community is amazingly resilient and
105:25
supportive of our schools our
105:27
firefighters give us thousands of
105:30
dollars every year firefighters police
105:33
departments help us too I am asking if
105:37
you so if the end game is prosperity and
105:41
quality of life for our communities are
105:45
you willing to partner with our schools
105:47
and with our local communities to really
105:51
improve quality of life which starts
105:53
with education I put I put it over two
105:58
billion dollars additional money into
105:59
education I believe you governor I'm
106:01
wondering if the man sitting next to you
106:03
is also of that person I don't I don't
106:07
have any more legislative sessions I
106:08
don't have any more money but I've done
106:11
my best
106:16
[Applause]
106:24
hello my name is Mike oof I just got a
106:26
quick question for mr. Easley um it's
106:29
just technical so no yeah the thing I
106:31
was wondering is so you're gonna have a
106:33
kind of a small operation in terms of
106:35
tonnage 4.2 million tons a year all
106:37
right you're gonna have all your fixed
106:38
infrastructure so based on what every
106:40
bit so base up whatever all the other
106:42
mines are going around here you're
106:43
probably gonna be at sixty probably 65
106:45
bucks a ton you get it down to Duluth
106:47
and you're going to transload it a few
106:49
times through the canals for another 25
106:50
that brings us to 90 then I know from
106:52
cept eel over to Europe it's 15s here at
106:55
105 is Riverdale gonna try to keep them
106:58
in or if they're going over to you know
107:01
Europe you're at a hundred and five
107:02
dollars a ton and you're competing
107:04
against Brazil with giant you know the
107:07
Brazil max class and all of us are a
107:09
ballet class ships which are I mean how
107:12
I know
107:13
Riverdale isn't yours but I mean what is
107:15
your confidence in somebody when they
107:17
have that high of a price
107:19
to jump over yeah so it's really hard to
107:23
look forward and see what the market
107:24
conditions will be when we enter the
107:25
market right and of course we'll have a
107:28
ramp up and it'll take some time and all
107:30
of that we're gonna build the plant
107:34
right it'll be a lower cost operation
107:38
than some and from that it should be
107:40
able to at least compete but we'll see
107:43
and we'll talk some more about the
107:44
future operating plans and so on when we
107:46
get there and you know I now understand
107:50
much more clearly I didn't know that
107:52
cliffs had such a problem at hip tack
107:54
that was news to me and now that I
107:57
understand that that changes things a
107:59
bit right I now understand your passion
108:01
but yeah well well and we'll we'll have
108:06
another discussion to go through easily
108:08
business on the job for three weeks I'm
108:19
Mike severs root
108:20
I am the president fairness building
108:22
trades we got a lot of construction
108:24
around the area that we need to get done
108:26
out there and this meeting here is the
108:30
path that unfortunately we're going down
108:32
we don't have a choice we have a choice
108:35
either to kill this thing or build it
108:37
and our standpoint with diary's building
108:41
trades we want to build this thing okay
108:43
and you guys going to work the steel
108:45
workers are going to work in there but
108:46
our whole thing here to begin with
108:48
tonight we understand cliffs Lorenzo I
108:50
mean he is he is the real deal there's
108:52
no doubt about it well we got six years
108:55
before we do anything right now we have
108:57
a path maybe it maybe it's gonna fall
109:00
apart who knows and if it does well then
109:03
we deadly promises broke it again but no
109:06
big deal we already don't wait six years
109:09
we got to build this thing period
109:12
we don't care who's gonna run the damn
109:13
thing afterwards we got to get a bill
109:15
first
109:21
all right now governor good good to see
109:24
ya
109:24
I would say this that in the last two
109:27
years we have had SR steel name changed
109:33
to Mesabi metallics name change to
109:36
Chippewa name change to Dubai name
109:38
change to DSA by the way DSA's motto is
109:41
1 plus 1 is 11 hey you know I don't know
109:45
they figured that out I mean it's
109:46
but anyway during that timeframe cliffs
109:49
has spent 75 million cash at you tack
109:53
uh-huh a hundred and fifteen million
109:57
dollars to buy out US Steel in our metal
110:00
over in Michigan they'll wrap that place
110:03
up at the Empire if they have to 750
110:06
million dollars for an HB I plant which
110:09
by the way is unforgivable to some of
110:12
you guys here your legislators you drove
110:14
the guy out of here there's a way you
110:15
did it's it's God darn it absurd what
110:18
are you doing but you know going forward
110:20
here these guys were supposed to be in
110:24
construction by September 1st 2017 I get
110:27
a letter of yours in my hand
110:28
governor okay you give him a God on
110:31
extension and October first came you
110:34
gave him another extension to December
110:36
and then the extension went to June of
110:39
this year
110:39
in fact tom clark i should say the
110:42
billionaire Tom Clark Yee hee so I'm
110:46
counting the days home we're gonna have
110:47
that money we're gonna be started in
110:49
June what did you guys do again another
110:52
extension ok this this this is beyond
110:55
absurd
110:56
I think the gal here said something like
110:58
if they don't have the money every God
111:00
darn cent okay to get going
111:03
next year you got to get these guys to
111:05
hell out of here
111:06
don't you get him out of here and I
111:09
might point out one other thing
111:12
you can let me know can I put on one
111:16
other thing governor the guy says it'll
111:18
take six years to get permits you know
111:20
place has been mining on the Iron Range
111:21
for over a hundred years okay they can't
111:24
get a permit they can't get it takes six
111:26
years to get a permit I mean this this
111:27
is this is beyond bizarre okay the whole
111:30
thing is beyond bizarre like go ahead
111:32
I'm going on you say you can properly
111:38
blame me for the green to those
111:40
extensions hindsight is 20/20 but you're
111:44
right we gave extensions and didn't get
111:47
the results that we have been promised
111:50
that's on me let me just say one other
111:52
thing well you guys have been monkeying
111:55
with SR and all these name changes
111:57
giving tax been running out iron ore
111:59
okay they've been running out of iron
112:01
ore and they have been totally neglected
112:03
during this whole process okay right now
112:05
we need a commitment from you guys that
112:07
we're going to get ore from this body to
112:10
Hibbing tact this place could run for 25
112:12
years there's nothing wrong with that
112:13
plant
112:14
we got 750 employees there 750 they'll
112:18
be on the street in five years okay now
112:21
you guys got the power to fix that can
112:23
we get that done can we get a commitment
112:24
from you you guys we got legislators
112:26
here can we get that commitment from
112:34
Mesabi metallics has owns Cordon Bleu
112:38
they own 5050 with cliffs the part in
112:41
yellow
112:41
if close wants to mind half of that and
112:45
that's something they can negotiate or
112:46
the all the way the judge is a district
112:49
court judge will make that decision
112:50
that's where Salyut alex is right now to
112:54
get the the authority from the court
112:57
which is required under state law it is
112:58
50/50 ownership if if cliffs ones has
113:02
other sites outside of the boundary here
113:04
then it wants some permits of mine then
113:07
they needs to apply for and it has that
113:11
right to do so okay Gavin oh thanks for
113:14
your time if materia becomes a major
113:25
investor can they take the profits and
113:28
transfer it to their tax haven in the
113:30
British Virgin Islands thank you sir
113:38
generating those kinds of profits I
113:41
won't be here somebody else can just
113:45
look into what's going on there I can't
113:47
answer well these these financier as I
113:51
said if he could have found us finance
113:54
Sears and Clark tried to do that for
113:56
months then we wouldn't be having that
113:59
discussion it's a global you know
114:01
financial markets and I can't I'm not
114:05
vouching for my career I'm not vouching
114:06
for any of them and except to say we got
114:09
to see money on the table it's got to be
114:11
invested it's got to be put in some the
114:13
US so a bank account and then money's
114:16
money but I'm not gonna dispute this
114:18
unless desire will have people moving
114:21
farther away I just want to say you know
114:26
you've been really extraordinarily
114:27
patient and also polite and I really
114:30
want to thank you for that and oke keep
114:34
going here till 9:30 if there's interest
114:37
in doing so
114:39
anyone wants to leave me sleek and you
114:41
certainly do so as well
114:43
yep Thank You governor and everybody you
114:47
just touched on something that made Rose
114:49
the question in my mind it's taken that
114:53
much time to raise the money by masaki
114:57
metallics mercury up
115:00
and although the phases in between when
115:02
cliffs decided they needed to fund their
115:07
their project in Ohio in the projects
115:11
year that money came from us sources
115:15
almost immediately it was days in that
115:18
money got offended this is their such
115:20
that telling us something that they
115:22
couldn't find Chase Manhattan banks or
115:24
US bank to fund this project on for
115:28
these other the for these other parties
115:30
and when it when he finally did it was
115:32
after months in my I mean I remember
115:34
hearing it was months before and now we
115:39
found somebody in some corner the world
115:41
is promising us dollars when real US
115:45
dollars on real projects came almost
115:48
immediately more power to cliffs I have
115:50
the highest respect for the way it's
115:53
been operated and they went from you
115:55
know very low of shock value asset value
115:59
to know where they are now and they've
116:02
done it very well and you know again I
116:05
invite them to come in here and and make
116:07
up application to take over whatever
116:09
property they have that they wanted to
116:12
develop for pro - additional resource I
116:16
mean I they say welcome that I guess I
116:18
guess I'm just calling into question the
116:20
the veracity of the funding that took so
116:25
long to to come I got I share your
116:28
concern okay
116:29
you know and I've been burned along with
116:32
all of you so many times that you know
116:35
all these representations for mr. Easley
116:36
has been been involved in this for a
116:38
month
116:40
you know I kind understand that why they
116:42
falling on deaf ears all I say is that
116:44
they are legally owned the project now
116:47
they have a legal right to try to
116:49
develop it if they don't then deal with
116:51
that but they have that right another
116:56
question for building a trades I'm a sub
116:58
metallic when do you guys plan on
117:00
ramping up and who's the general
117:02
contractor you guys got in mind for you
117:07
guys Mesaba metallic who are you guys
117:09
gonna have for general contractor out
117:10
there and when do you plan on ramping up
117:12
getting the trades out there so looking
117:15
at the schedule now as you look at the
117:17
need to complete engineering all these
117:18
other things that have to happen at this
117:20
point I think you will see a much higher
117:22
level of activity coming in the spring
117:24
probably truth be told to get up to the
117:26
levels that you got it that you're
117:28
talking about but there will be more
117:29
activity going as we move forward and
117:31
more funding comes in and we finally hit
117:33
the preconditions for the credit
117:34
facility and so on so it's just a steady
117:36
process going forward okay so we've got
117:44
local contractors that that are already
117:46
working on-site we've got more that are
117:49
set up to be on-site so you know we'll
117:52
give you more with that as we go forward
117:55
yeah yes so there are two contractors
118:01
that we've been working with on this
118:04
project right all right no I mean sorry
118:10
I didn't didn't get that you want
118:11
specific names fair enough
118:15
mr. Healy my name is John canis I'm a
118:17
minor here for 33 years worked six years
118:22
in Alaska on construction projects so
118:24
starting out with the pipeline and there
118:27
that pipeline was basically built in
118:29
about three years 800 miles and over a
118:31
couple mountain ranges and and things
118:33
can be done you know if you put your
118:35
mind to it anyway the first question was
118:38
ethics are you gonna be truthful with us
118:40
tell us the truth
118:42
you've had so many lies going out that
118:44
there's 80 percent complete or 75
118:46
percent complete it wasn't you
118:48
personally but it was the company before
118:51
you and
118:52
and and treat your contractors with
118:55
respect your suppliers with respect it's
118:58
been it's it's not a really good history
119:00
that you have up here so we hope that
119:03
would improve and what you put out in
119:06
the press make it be accurate not not
119:09
lies they were out in out lies the
119:11
governor knows that you know we've read
119:14
that in the newspaper we're really
119:16
moving along we're gonna do this do that
119:18
and it doesn't happen but the general
119:20
contractor you've got to look at people
119:22
like Bechtel or or Peter Kiewit somebody
119:26
that goes in and gets the job done if
119:28
you have little contractors willing
119:30
piecemeal and you trying to manage it
119:32
yourself you're not gonna do it it's not
119:34
going to turn out well you've got to
119:36
have a general contractor that oversees
119:39
the project where you can stand back and
119:42
make sure he has money to do the job
119:44
that's all I have to say be ethical okay
119:48
well thanks
120:06
well again the leases are approved as
120:10
part of the permit to mine to get to a
120:12
permit to mine takes several steps and
120:16
the first is that a company has to
120:18
decide what it is they want to mine list
120:20
you know as I mentioned cliffs could
120:21
come in with a permit to mine and all
120:22
that red stuff right now okay if they
120:24
wanted to do that here's what they have
120:25
to do they have to first off they have
120:27
to do their own background engineering
120:29
then they have to submit a request to
120:33
the department for consideration of
120:36
permit to mine that means they have to
120:38
go through environmental review and
120:39
these are the dreaded words you've
120:41
always heard environmental impact
120:42
statement an environmental impact
120:43
statement on a large project takes time
120:46
and in large part because it's open for
120:48
public comment and because the public
120:49
gets a comment on it and we have to
120:50
address the comments it it makes it a
120:52
fairly lengthy period of time
120:55
that requires during the EAS process
120:57
really full examination of the whole
121:00
operation it's not just the pit they're
121:02
going to take but it's the
121:04
infrastructure they're going to use it's
121:05
the transportation they're going to use
121:07
it's the emissions they're going to
121:09
generate it's the water they're going to
121:11
need the water you're going to generate
121:12
it's a whole description of that plan
121:13
that process just frankly takes a long
121:16
time and I don't think three years is
121:17
unreasonable to expect it will take that
121:19
amount of time once an environmental
121:21
review is done then that we actually get
121:23
into the permits that are required and
121:25
we talk often about the permit to mine
121:27
because that's what we're talking about
121:28
here it's it's that's a permit that
121:31
comes from the Department Natural
121:32
Resources and that takes some of the
121:33
information from the EIS but the permit
121:35
to mine is ultimately a full description
121:37
of how the whole operation works the you
121:39
know infrastructure the processing the
121:41
the disposal of waste and everything
121:44
else the whole process takes you know a
121:46
couple of years and that in addition
121:48
they need several other permits so they
121:50
need air quality permit and your water
121:51
quality permits the water appropriation
121:53
permits they typically need as a wetland
121:54
permit so there's a number of you know
121:57
up to two dozen additional permits
121:58
underneath all all of which have to be
122:00
processed in the same through your time
122:01
so what I'm suggesting is I don't think
122:03
it's unreasonable to expect it for a new
122:05
permit to mine
122:07
it could take up to six years to get a
122:10
new permit to mine if a company has an
122:12
existing operation and they have a
122:15
permit to mine it describes like like
122:17
that does what the pit boundary is but
122:20
if they have adjacent land of that pit
122:22
boundaries is not included in that
122:23
permit to mine they can come in for a
122:24
permit amendment a permanent amendment
122:26
can be done in a much quicker amount of
122:28
time we've done several laws in the last
122:29
few years but to start with I'm sorry it
122:35
was six months to a year
122:36
the permanent memory can go pretty
122:37
quickly but the so so that's the
122:42
timeframe you're looking at if they if
122:44
the project were to die and the permit
122:46
goes along with it the lease has become
122:49
available and they are transferable to a
122:51
new company and before those leases can
122:52
be xyx executed exercised we have to go
122:56
through another permit to mine process
123:08
let's here again on this on this map
123:12
everything that's in blue is currently
123:15
100% owned by Masonic metallics what's
123:17
in yellow which is 54% the majority
123:21
ownership currently is the Masonic
123:23
metallics hundred-percent the yellow is
123:25
jointly 50-50 Mesabi cliffs but that is
123:29
in dispute in court right now so the
123:31
court has yet to agree that that is the
123:33
case and in the red which is 100% Mesabi
123:37
which is all or excuse me I understand
123:38
cliffs which is also in court it's 5% so
123:41
the majority ownership of the mineral
123:44
leases right now is clearly with massage
123:46
metallics the but the leases are
123:53
approved by a virtue of the the the
123:55
opportunity dig in that pit area is
123:58
approved by virtue of the pit that I
124:01
excuse me the the permit to mine and so
124:04
if the if the permit to mine goes away
124:07
the fact that has 50% ownership in that
124:10
yellow does not give them the authority
124:12
to go in and start taking those result
124:15
they still have to submit a permit to
124:17
mine that has ultimately approved
124:29
how long it takes in the state all these
124:38
hoops and all these issues and it's
124:40
going to take six years
124:42
I mean structurally what's in this
124:50
staples and I'm not saying it's direct
124:52
comparison but Lorenzo went to the state
124:57
of Ohio for the hbi plant and he sat
125:01
down with the governor he told him what
125:03
he wanted to do he said he needed it he
125:05
needed to go fast and he needed What did
125:08
he say five million dollars and in five
125:11
to six months five months got a perm end
125:15
right on all apartments all everything
125:18
that you described so sat there with all
125:21
those permits in five months on the
125:24
Great Lakes in a state on on a
125:28
brownfield site this is a brownfield
125:30
site right we're on the Great Lakes I
125:33
appreciate those things that's why we
125:35
live here but how can it take the state
125:37
of Ohio right strong Democratic state
125:41
generally no different than us five
125:44
months to do something where you're
125:46
talking we can even five months get a
125:48
permit to mine extension I mean that's
125:51
the structure he's not mining in Ohio I
125:53
and I understand that it's what I'm
125:55
saying but he still got a complete
125:57
industry right he got the hbi plant
126:00
completely permitted and old by the way
126:02
they threw thirty million dollars in
126:04
you're absolutely right that it takes
126:06
way too long ago so I and 2014 I
126:09
proposed it steps that would cut cut the
126:12
timeline in half and various groups came
126:15
in and said no we want all the
126:17
Commission at a public comment period
126:18
that is it didn't pass it's a very valid
126:21
point to bring you the next legislative
126:23
session and say we've got to speed this
126:25
up I couldn't agree with you more
126:26
wait you along to go through this
126:28
process and it's not just this industry
126:30
you look at timber right
126:32
got timber falling on the ground dead
126:34
same rules of the same well exactly and
126:37
that's what's broken here and it needs
126:40
to get fixed it does you're right guy
126:42
agree with you and I tried failed maybe
126:44
the next one be more successful
126:46
well it's yes sir I don't have a dog to
126:49
hunt in this thing I just have
126:52
information to provide to those that do
126:55
not have the information one thing is I
126:58
notice thank you for letting you speak
127:00
here you're a governor correct you're
127:02
not a dictator I said I looked yeah
127:04
you're your governor you're not a
127:06
dictator in history isn't it classical
127:09
to underbid something and then to do
127:11
everything you can to get the high
127:13
bidder to fail
127:15
it's called robber baron they're they're
127:17
robber barons they're operating like
127:19
robber barons is what they're doing your
127:21
interest is trying to get as much money
127:23
as you can for the contractors and get
127:26
people paid and get the project on
127:28
that's what you're want to do now I hear
127:32
this thing all this market we can't take
127:35
this market I hope most people in here
127:38
know that the majority of steel used in
127:41
the United States is not made in the
127:43
United States
127:45
so as a society we're gonna have to
127:48
decide if we're going to allow the
127:51
exportation of slave economic slave
127:55
labor in foreign countries which will
127:58
undermine our unions and our good-paying
128:01
jobs there's there's no other way to to
128:04
handle that I mean we're allowing people
128:06
that work for barely nothing to take
128:09
away our good jobs and as a society we
128:12
have to make a decision whether we're
128:13
gonna allow that or not now they're
128:16
saying all poor heavy pack and I they
128:18
haven't got any ore
128:20
well I just happen to be lucky to fall
128:23
in some information in the late 90s 97
128:27
98 come home from work I worked at Mynt
128:30
tech I'm retired
128:31
I worked for 33 years there's ignoring
128:34
my neighbors says Bob do you know what
128:37
happened today I says no what happened
128:39
and he he says Henry and I can't forget
128:42
his member his last name but it was
128:44
Henry B
128:45
he used to be superintendent for Erie
128:47
and he became a consultant for the iron
128:50
ore industry and he comes into this
128:52
business I won't say where it is because
128:55
they might not want to know who it is
128:57
but they come this guy comes in a
128:59
business he says you are still treated
129:01
the w-2 pet now for any of you that
129:04
don't know about W to survive as yeah
129:06
okay I'm gonna try to get this tight
129:08
point in fuel in the Buell City Hall
129:10
where I live there used to be a big
129:12
picture the W to Pitt and I asked to
129:15
reboot a day that God bless let me just
129:16
died recently I said hey what is this he
129:19
says that's the w-2 fit for you or still
129:21
I says that thing is huge
129:24
that's five miles north to south it's
129:26
west of 25 and it goes 13 miles he said
129:30
yep that's a big big body of war and I
129:33
have sources that know that that or is
129:35
high-grade very little over burn very
129:38
soft ease the grind it is high silica
129:40
thank you yeah you know thank you thank
129:43
you very much I need to get this one
129:45
thing in you got 30 seconds this one
129:47
thing in there's enough or for 25 years
129:51
for min tack and for hippie taconite if
129:53
they divide that our body because the
129:55
ore body by Aurora that they traded for
129:58
you is still is 350 feet deep and blue
130:00
black or 80% and it's the richest
130:03
largest natural ore deposit in the
130:05
history of North America you were still
130:08
sitting on that by Aurora thank you
130:10
think about that okay thank you
130:12
you know I could agree more about the
130:14
you know a us rolling over for foreign
130:17
imports Jim over sir the fighting that
130:19
others to for 40 years and dudes credit
130:23
the president Trump's Dunmore stand up
130:25
and protect our industry than anybody
130:27
else around so give him credit for that
130:29
you know Thank You governor just a very
130:31
quick brief question for mister Heasley
130:33
could you once and for all address the
130:36
press release that was issued just two
130:38
weeks ago by Mousavi metallics potential
130:40
partner in this project mercury ax and
130:43
I'm talking about the original version
130:45
of the release that went out of its way
130:47
to highlight the potential involvement
130:49
of s or steel in this project which I
130:52
believe and I think a lot of people in
130:53
this room would agree really showed a
130:55
remarkable lack of awareness for
130:57
the communities that the Iron Range have
130:59
been through over the course the last
131:00
decade under Esther's leadership of this
131:03
project so yeah you know so I saw the
131:11
same press release rights saw that and
131:13
and and I understand that mercury ax has
131:16
been using SR as an advisor on this
131:18
investment now SR has got some really
131:21
significant reasons to want to see this
131:23
project go forward they've got
131:24
guarantees you know of something like a
131:27
billion dollars or something that they
131:28
owe and seeing the project succeed
131:30
actually helps them tremendously so
131:32
they've got a reason to try to help it
131:34
go forward that's not a bad thing and I
131:36
understand you've had a history that's
131:37
challenging and you know you're not
131:40
happy I get it right I can't really
131:42
address any of that and I wasn't here
131:44
for any of that and you know fair enough
131:46
no no no I'm talking about your history
131:48
how about your history right so so I
131:52
understand your frustration right
131:54
my goal simple is to see this thing go
131:57
forward it's to see the project move
131:59
right and if mercury oh come in with
132:01
more capital and they want to be equity
132:03
and that's great it's always great to
132:06
have more equity right so I'm just
132:09
anxious to see them move forward and be
132:11
part of the team going forward I think
132:13
that's a great outcome that's a hundred
132:15
and twelve billion dollar company that
132:17
is globally active in the metals world I
132:19
mean it's an energy they do really a lot
132:22
of energy as well that's never a partner
132:24
that I look sideways at right I'd love
132:27
to have them be part of that
132:31
[Music]
132:50
well I should say I don't know what
132:54
their involvement is and as far as I
132:55
know right now with new by they don't
132:58
have any involvement
132:59
McCrea is looking at the possibility of
133:03
investing and the other ones who brought
133:06
up the subject yes sir which came out of
133:09
the blue as far as I was concerned too
133:11
so I cannot only say I don't know well
133:24
hi share your view I think they even
133:27
just dishonest throughout the whole
133:30
process
133:41
well I told my courier when we had a
133:44
conversation when I thought of the
133:46
vesser and why they should not be have
133:49
any involvement with the financing part
133:51
they're trying to get some of their
133:53
money out of the the project and I you
133:56
know that that's another realm that does
133:58
not I don't I can't answer I don't know
134:03
I don't know what Esther who carry out
134:06
here comes out here next month I'll ask
134:09
him and you should ask who and we can
134:10
all assume that it's a global financial
134:18
market and all these people in Dubai and
134:22
Switzerland and Argentina and everywhere
134:26
else are doing things that I haven't
134:28
totally unaware of and the money's
134:31
moving around the challenges the
134:33
challenge capture 650 million of that
134:37
for this project
134:43
we've been through this before else
134:47
somebody wants to add original yes sir
134:50
yes the problem that I'm seeing with
134:53
this and I've been going to these silly
134:54
meetings ever since it was MSI now we've
134:59
been given a line a bull by the DNR by
135:01
the MPCA
135:02
and the things that they told us they
135:07
didn't stand behind they've made rulings
135:10
that don't make any sense whatsoever
135:12
and they're not treating everybody
135:15
fairly
135:15
I see our local companies hip tack US
135:19
Steel getting fined all the time for air
135:22
veldt our quality violations you don't
135:25
see that with this company and yet they
135:27
covered the whole of snowball Lake and
135:30
everything around it in red dust which
135:33
we were assured by the MPCA would never
135:35
cross that line that they drew on a map
135:37
there were no fines now until you start
135:41
treating everybody equally and applying
135:44
the laws equally to all of them this is
135:46
not right these extensions as we've had
135:49
pointed out you said you were at fault I
135:52
appreciate you taking the blame for it
135:54
but put a stop to them don't give them
135:57
special privileges don't give them any
136:00
more money don't treat them with kit
136:03
gloves make sure that these have to toe
136:07
the line with the laws in place like
136:09
everybody else does
136:10
thank you thank you
136:13
[Applause]
136:18
yes just another construction question
136:21
how many construction workers are on
136:23
site today okay so you're gonna go from
136:39
50 people today and you're seeing in
136:41
March you want to ramp up so when you
136:44
ramp up in March how many men and women
136:47
construction workers are you
136:49
anticipating having on that project in
136:52
March I can't give you a month-by-month
136:54
headcount projections you know we can
136:58
have this conversation in a later time
136:59
but you know I think you know what it
137:02
means to ramp up construction right okay
137:03
so we're talking about adding activity
137:06
bringing more people to and more work
137:07
and but I'm not I'm not here to give you
137:11
a month-by-month headcount numbers just
137:14
will do it we can talk about that later
137:15
if you like
137:38
and you said one of the things was
137:42
you're gonna be lower-cost okay so lots
137:44
of questions are on the room you said
137:46
you very open you and labour is gonna be
137:49
the same right it's an or body that's
137:51
very similar equipments of a size you're
137:54
gonna have same vendors I'm gonna buy
137:56
parts same pricing you're gonna buy fuel
137:58
from the same vendor same pricing you're
138:00
gonna buy electrons right similar
138:02
pricing chemicals same pricing I want to
138:07
know how your plan is to be such a lower
138:09
cost that this makes it an economic
138:11
project compared to all the rest of the
138:14
businesses in a region so you know I've
138:19
looked at benchmarking of various mines
138:22
on the on the range and I see how they
138:24
stack up I'm not going to go through
138:26
with your department by department costs
138:28
it's not over here for tonight if if you
138:31
want to work with us to bet I assume you
138:33
work for cliffs I do right so if you
138:35
want to benchmark we can get together
138:36
sometime in the future and and do that
138:39
and it would be interesting but I'm not
138:41
I'm not gonna go through and just and
138:42
give up you know for that and it's not a
138:45
benchmarking exercise because you can't
138:48
go through section or Department costs
138:50
for you to come up with an answer you
138:52
would have to describe this group a
138:54
game-changer because you don't have it I
138:56
mean it would have to be something
138:57
substantial so high governor they seen
139:04
you again thank you for hosting this
139:05
again my name is Dave Lissa Garden the
139:07
mayor of Aurora and like the governor
139:10
we do believe actions speak louder than
139:12
words and my question would be that mr.
139:16
Lenoir stated that if you didn't
139:18
complete the project by the pellet tiser
139:22
by 2019 he could pull the leases if he
139:26
was to tell you or the state of
139:28
Minnesota was to tell you that if you
139:29
did not finish by the end of 2019 we
139:32
were gonna pull them leases because
139:34
we're done we're moving on would you
139:36
continue to move forward at this moment
139:41
well this is for mr. this is for mr. mr.
139:44
Easley it's a fair question so if we say
139:48
the state of Minnesota says we played
139:50
this game actions speak louder than
139:52
words because you're very well-spoken
139:54
you paint a really really good picture
139:56
but we've heard that like four or five
139:58
times now so the question is if the
140:00
state of Minnesota says you will
140:03
complete that pelletize er or we will
140:05
pull the leases at the end of 2019
140:08
will you continue to move forward thank
140:10
you a couple of things I that's not what
140:12
the leases actually say so we can go
140:16
into this in more detail no it is a it
140:23
is a grounds for termination it doesn't
140:26
say they will be terminated so it's
140:27
grounds for termination so you know I
140:38
can say whatever I want I'm not gonna be
140:40
governor into those in the first first
140:43
first six days of - 2019 sir it's just a
140:47
fair question if you could just answer
140:49
it if if the state of Minnesota let you
140:52
know right up front stand up if you are
140:55
not going to complete it at the end of
140:56
2018 will you move forward and will you
140:59
for the complete this project yeah so
141:02
you know I hear your question we're not
141:04
gonna get into hypotheticals that you I
141:05
understand what you're trying to achieve
141:07
you know as you ask the question you
141:10
know we're not gonna get into this
141:11
discussion and it's it's just we're not
141:14
gonna have been very patient very
141:19
tolerant question last question the very
141:23
back there then the next question
141:38
that's the decision in the next
141:40
administration Oh make the next to be
141:51
done building a pelletize er in 16
141:55
months is that even possible
141:57
because I guarantee you every trace guy
141:59
in here will say nope so well-well
142:06
happen especially if you don't start
142:07
until March yeah he's not able to give
142:11
you the answers that you want and that's
142:14
where again things are right now where
142:17
they are they're not as clear as they
142:18
should be
142:19
I wish they were they are what they are
142:21
I just ask you get a look at what the
142:24
legal realities are and what happens in
142:28
the cap whole society when somebody owns
142:30
something and they have a right to
142:31
operate it whether somebody else thinks
142:34
they're likely to succeed or not I thank
142:36
you very much you've been very very
142:38
patient very tolerant thank you very
142:40
much
142:42
