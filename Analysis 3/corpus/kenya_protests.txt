China by any means is helping in
01:00
spoiling our environment China is not a
01:03
country that is in solidarity with
01:05
Kenyan China is here for its own
01:08
personal benefits it's unfortunate that
01:10
our country our country and our
01:12
government is accepting to be lied to
01:15
and to be cheated by China why are they
01:17
not doing this project in China why are
01:19
they coming here to spoil our
01:21
environment so we are telling the
01:22
government that Kenyans come first
01:24
forget China forget everything else we
01:26
want our environment protected and want
01:28
clean and healthy communities thriving

well and we don't understand why our
02:08
country at this moment can accept you to
02:11
come and they introduce a coal plant in
02:13
Louisville coal plants usage of coal is
02:17
an outdated technology which is not
02:19
clean and many countries in the world
02:20
are trying to stop it it's very
02:22
unfortunate that our country is
02:23
accepting to have Lama as a dusty pink
02:26
because Lama is going to be one single
02:29
place that will pollute the country in
02:32
the entire of Africa I think will be the
02:34
worst point of pollution if that that
02:36
plant will come in the entire country in
02:38
the dead continent of Africa
