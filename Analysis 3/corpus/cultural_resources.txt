cultural heritage for example the
00:50
creation of the Apache leap special
00:52
management area is a critical part of
00:54
the land exchange legislation that
00:56
passed in 2014 a result of early
00:59
congressional consultation with Native
01:01
American tribes the purpose of the
01:03
management area is threefold to preserve
01:06
the natural character of Apache leap
01:07
continued public access to oak flat area
01:10
protect and conserve the cultural and
01:12
archaeological resources another
01:15
outgrowth of early consultation was a
01:17
decision by resolution copper to grant
01:19
access to mining areas in and around the
01:21
oak flat campground although the
01:23
campground itself ultimately will be
01:25
closed this agreement guarantees that
01:27
camping and other outdoor recreational
01:29
activities will go on at Oak Flat for
01:31
many years to come in addition to
01:34
protection for Apache leap and public
01:36
access to the oak flat campground the
01:38
Atlantic Shane legislation also requires
01:41
government to government consultation
01:42
with Native American tribes the US
01:45
Department of Agriculture will engage in
01:47
