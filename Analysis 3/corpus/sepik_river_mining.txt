Claytus Yambon - Environmental and Cultural Impacts of Mining on the Sepik River, PNG
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iui6Bt0ux04
our relationship with Papua New Guinea
00:29
is a long one
00:30
especially in the Sepik River region
00:32
from where our guests are from in the
00:35
Seebeck River region one of our board
00:37
members has been with us for almost 30
00:39
years
00:39
Elaine long's also the director of
00:42
culture in a gallery has been building
00:44
relations between the communities and
00:47
the sea pink and our communities here in
00:48
Canada those programs that we've done in
00:52
partnership in the Seebeck have include
00:54
maternal health nursing programs health
00:57
programs and most recently we've been
01:00
working with them on some of the
01:01
critical issues that they are facing
01:03
with regards to mine so there's much to
01:09
be shared with this story and of course
01:12
it's most appropriate comes from the
01:13
people of the land so it's a real honor
01:17
to have you know Gladys and Edward
01:20
see here so without further ado I'd like
01:22
to ask clay this young bond to join me
01:25
up here and it's maybe to walk us
01:27
through some of what's happening in this
01:29
effect so here's some of the key issues
01:35
that are being faced there maybe so we
01:40
have awareness exploitation consultation
01:43
cultural sensitivity of local economy I
01:46
am from Papua New Guinea my name is
01:49
Leticia moon and and I have my two
01:53
colleges over there and Ed Wood Des
01:56
Moines and in Suwannee we are from the
01:59
same we are from Mississippi province
02:01
here listed at the province eleven
02:04
promised in Papua New Guinea nineteen
02:06
prophets I mean it's not only one
02:08
province but we are one of those
02:10
problems is very close to the border of
02:12
Indonesia and we live along this the
02:17
great river called the mighty sea big
02:19
river and actually the Sepik River is
02:22
not the original name was you know some
02:23
way come from a German people that the
02:26
name is but name is River and yeah CP
02:31
River is divided into three tribes
02:33
there's a port right they from first
02:36
year they have the idea another tribes
02:38
and then from here today is another
02:41
tribe and we have more people we only
02:46
central part of cific and then we we own
02:52
the center part of cific and we
02:53
recognize as a different tribe we have
02:57
our own language we have our own you
03:00
know culture and you know you can see
03:03
most of our hard work and our in a car
03:06
to display around the in you know some
03:08
sort of some museums around the world so
03:11
in that regard we think that this money
03:17
will be somewhere the mining year that
03:23
we are not anything belongs to the mind
03:26
we will not benefit from the mind
03:29
it's sort of very small people over
03:32
there there's a population about 1,000
03:34
people are just around this area will be
03:36
benefiting from that mine and the gap
03:38
from your government and national
03:39
government and from here and down to the
03:45
amount of the river to the end of the
03:47
river there's about more than 50
03:49
religious and about this little
03:52
thousands of people are living there and
03:54
the impact will be just you know it
03:57
you'll be already they did the small
03:59
people here will be benefiting and the
04:01
other enjoyed life and we rest of the
04:03
people downstream we are benefiting we
04:05
are getting an out of the mind and a
04:07
government will be disrupted but as I
04:11
said we are not in the standard we have
04:15
we still enjoy our culture I'm in the
04:17
cultural value I'd really in a social
04:20
and economical benefit you know we are
04:24
not getting any further out there we
04:26
still lack of you know basic services
04:29
like the hospitals schools and other
04:31
stuff other thing but you know if the
04:34
mining goes but we are not you know as I
04:37
said the government the infrastructure
04:39
is not there and if mining go it will be
04:42
much worse for us so there's nothing
04:46
that we can stop the mind there's
04:49
nothing stopping you know where the
04:51
government the government and the
04:53
company you know the government invite
04:55
the company to not take on you know to
04:58
operate and it will be so difficult for
05:01
us so but days we just you know looking
05:04
for option if there is under
05:06
circumstances of that we can try to do
05:09
about to control the mind to do it in a
05:12
way that you know not to you know just
05:17
in you know we can be destroying we can
05:22
we they have to be you know okay for our
05:26
our life because our life is the river
05:31
yeah yes yeah yes Papua New Guinea
05:34
because Papua New Guinea
05:35
we have been independent by Australian
05:39
for years ago and we have our own laws
05:43
to guide us through and our lower about
05:47
the land was just so perfectly was we
05:49
really appreciate like that 90 percent
05:53
95 percent of the line is belongs to
05:55
people that was good really appreciate
05:58
that but one law that really it's
06:01
affecting us is that the law that
06:03
government we just only owned the
06:06
surface and the 1615 your soil is owned
06:10
by the government so like mine you know
06:14
you just forgot that they can just walk
06:16
through and tell us to just remove what
06:19
is on the surface and then go on it then
06:21
they know dig the thing so that's all
06:24
law is affecting us
06:26
it's a we have two big big big Riven in
06:30
our country one is fly wanna cific this
06:35
fly river and there's a mind of the
06:38
Equality of 30 mind and it's operate
06:41
form was more than 25 years now man you
06:44
can see I'll fly flower vase now the
06:48
sedimentation the reverse just stays
06:50
polluted and the government are doing
06:54
something for people to you know run a
06:56
rehabilitation program or something to
06:57
try to resettle before some way and you
07:00
know we see peak are different from play
07:03
river these people are still died you
07:05
know if this anomaly and age they you
07:07
know style and we simply go very
07:09
different you know our life is just
07:11
community from London so you know fly
07:16
river can be damage and destroy and we
07:21
thought if the mind is they are you know
07:24
- year
07:26
will be the next victim yes the superior
07:31
people have been living there for many
07:33
years we have been coming you know
07:37
there's a we we we we we live and your
07:40
for many years we will end your life and
07:42
you know it's still practiced today we
07:44
have our own battle system you know we
07:46
have you know in in in trade lines
07:50
between the air in England people and
07:52
house and all our culture you know
07:54
activity and whatever we live on it is
07:57
all depend on the river and it's our
08:00
life you know once the river is gone you
08:03
know our our life is gone it's
08:05
completely gone
08:06
so it so it's a great thing for us yeah
08:16
and then that's a good thing that if you
08:18
if you care for the manga rush and they
08:21
okay for you and that's it there's a
08:22
great content you know we have now not
08:25
only mine we have a logging company in
08:27
place there is a logging up the up and
08:30
down the river now we talk boat and and
08:33
and the fondant that the boat pose that
08:37
the Asian people are just traveling up
08:38
almost early to the to the end almost
08:41
here from here taking all the logs
08:43
downstream and it's it's a not a danger
08:47
for us you know it's they're going you
08:49
know to and fro from night and day and
08:52
it's really you know that not another
08:55
disaster for us so it's happening now
08:57
but a mining will be just just coming
09:00
very shortly so yeah so if the if our
09:04
logs are gone it's not another thing for
09:06
us because we live when logs because the
09:09
logs that give us life like building
09:11
kennels you know it's a kind of say our
09:14
everyday use every family's up about
09:16
five six or ten cane was more than 10
09:19
cameras for you know the kids the
09:22
mothers and fathers so if the logging is
09:24
continuing you know and then this
09:27
there's another thing again that that
09:28
our love you will be gone and you know
09:32
and what can we depend on that's another
09:34
thing and all sort of mind if mine is
09:37
going if the simple servant doesn't
09:38
build up like
09:39
River you know our log who died they can
09:43
you know it's a tropical country the we
09:49
have the our you know the wetland the
09:52
other the triskin you know survive for
09:54
six months in the wet and then they and
09:57
that you know they can you know in a
10:01
sunlight the the day they have enough
10:04
you know I was trying to you know go for
10:06
another six point in the wet again so
10:08
once we have the sedimentation build-up
10:10
the water will rise and you know flow
10:13
the bank
10:14
that's the desert another thing I you
10:15
know effect you know affecting people
10:17
fly so you know the same thing in
10:19
affected us as well if the rise of water
10:22
all our lot will die no trees will die I
10:25
mean not a lot but trees yeah so yeah
10:30
that's the the muck that's the mountain
10:34
just a place way up the mining will be
10:38
so the money actually will be a big mine
10:41
and then we have these people from
10:44
love's not Laos but there was a the off
10:48
Panos
10:50
did you know probably employees on
10:52
people to go and give a basic awareness
10:54
a little bit of honor sort of people
10:56
telling us a body the mind and our their
10:58
personal the mind and you know they the
11:02
quantity of the the product and the
11:06
average you know years of the the
11:09
operation all this but the one thing
11:11
they indicated was that it would be a
11:15
bit mine and they will be about five to
11:18
six feet they'll be and then one kid
11:21
will be about thirty years and then once
11:25
the 30s is over and then go to another
11:27
people another thirty years and imagine
11:29
that if days go for up a sixth more than
11:32
six mile I mean on modified Pete is more
11:36
than allergies and you know it's really
11:39
a threat for us and I do a in a little
11:43
bit of us row down the river to try to
11:47
get the view of the people about a mind
11:48
and all the people are there with a
11:51
negative correspond tender now
11:53
it's our life if government or we are
11:57
not getting any support from the end
11:58
another community in any way then I was
12:02
our option is that physically we'll just
12:05
go and that's the that's the end of us
12:07
because we have their full evidence
12:11
before the operation of the mind so
12:14
there were to be a best line survey to
12:17
get older you know statistics figure of
12:19
the people and schools and agriculture
12:21
whatever like sampling of the water and
12:23
that can give me enough evidence for
12:25
appreciate very we have this destruction
12:27
and we can take the company of
12:29
government to you know to some areas to
12:32
see it first went to justice and
12:34
talented area we have the evidence here
12:37
this the first day I we arrived here I
12:40
was so impressed at me and I would a
12:43
Nancy that we have this one but come
12:47
from the chips here I mean we were not
12:51
expecting that but to be a very simple
12:53
people back home and to be very you know
12:56
I like cheap from a faraway land giving
13:00
us invitation and asking us to you know
13:04
give an invitation to stay and do
13:05
anything everyone I was just really
13:07
appreciate so that was that we have to
13:09
fight all from there and this was yeah
13:25
they're all yoga forests yeah yeah that
13:29
was yeah we just go to the old-growth
13:30
forest and you know seeing the forest it
13:32
was my dream reflecting back and to my
13:36
place you know beside that mountain
13:38
there's a disarrange called the young
13:42
the Oh
13:46
awesome range and it's a third largest
13:49
forest in the world that justit lies
13:52
close to that mining area and you know
13:55
the government was trying to do
13:57
something about logging and all this but
13:59
there's a deduct legislature in
14:01
untouched virgin area that nobody knows
14:04
that place there's a used log in things
14:07
that is there but the government was
14:09
planning to bring a log over there but
14:11
now the mining is another trade for that
14:13
the huge forest so you know that forest
14:17
does supplies you know anything
14:18
something in any way and I was looking
14:21
at that those trees out there and I
14:23
might you know I I just walk us back
14:25
home to this that the tourists if the
14:27
forest can be destroyed it was something
14:30
set for us again you know in that
14:32
mountain for us because down the river
14:34
we have this sort of a very soft which
14:37
doesn't really last long for diving and
14:39
it's like motto what more oh we don't
14:42
have this sort of boats you know stop
14:45
pick on me we we have this dugout pick a
14:47
nose and put outboard motors and you
14:49
know who travel so those are the place
14:51
where that you actually give us logs to
14:55
you know we can use to help us in our
14:58
commercial need yeah the specific yam
15:04
was enjoying in other question is that
15:07
can they our you know the generation can
15:10
enjoy the city in the future you know
15:13
they enjoying the time when I flood it's
15:17
a big question for us now if the mind
15:21
the in fact of the mine you know it
15:23
would be a great thing for us they'd be
15:25
know that the boys when our kids our
15:28
children our grandchildren would not
15:30
enjoy their life yes we are all possible
15:34
people we say the same water and we say
15:40
that the same water you know go through
15:43
my needs go through my so it did why so
15:48
it just come back to you again it's just
15:49
the same water we just live in and you
15:52
know
15:54
it's just that I just gonna leave my
15:56
final would like you know we are first
16:00
big people and we have thought we
16:03
respect the great nation of that you
16:05
know the Canada and the unities people
16:09
here they're just just a great people
16:11
you know just observing the calcium but
16:13
life is just we have this melody in
16:15
there by looking back to us you know
16:18
it's a tiny tiny country and it just as
16:21
just a developed country but our
16:24
government is just you know there's a
16:26
some some some big countries are just
16:28
putting the string around your neck to
16:30
tell them down you know going do some
16:32
really do isn't do you do do this and
16:34
that so adding the government has not
16:37
ever strength to say you know say no so
16:41
it's a it's a big thing that I just want
16:43
to live here that you know it's a what
16:46
Mortimer outward is a big thing
