Mining Battles: Uranium, Coal, and Gold
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sh0_Wf8F4RM
today on earth focus mining a new film
00:13
on conflict over a uranium mill in
00:15
Colorado and reports on the unexpected
00:18
effects of mining coal in South Africa
00:20
and gold in Ecuador coming up on earth
00:23
focus filmmaker Suzanne Barraza screened
00:30
her new film uranium driving at the 2014
00:34
environmental film festival in the
00:36
nation's capital promise of jobs from a
00:39
proposed uranium mill is a tantalizing
00:41
prospect for an economically devastated
00:44
Colorado town until environmentalist
00:46
step in to try to shut it down will jobs
00:49
or Health and Environment prevail the
00:52
film documents how a local community
00:54
comes to grips with the dilemma we're
00:59
trying to open up a uranium mill and
01:02
they're trying to shut it down you know
01:04
it's a big dream people are looking
01:07
forward to these jobs I wanna I wanted
01:09
to understand that there's people here
01:10
yeah but I don't think they I mean
01:13
there's no compromise they don't care
01:16
about us
01:23
nuclear power was supposed to be our
01:25
future a lot of this town was here
01:27
because of Union Carbide and then when
01:29
they left we're still here there they're
01:32
long gone it's almost like we're still
01:36
surviving but it's just kind of like
01:38
those last few 4s we want to keep
01:40
breathing but we've got to get something
01:41
in here to do it nuclear energy remains
01:46
our largest source of fuel that produces
01:48
no carbon emissions we'll need to
01:51
increase our supply of nuclear it is the
01:53
first uranium mill to be built in the
01:55
United States in 25 years the only thing
01:57
I'm interested in this mail get stopped
02:00
if you're only hearing the piece about
02:03
jobs you're not protecting your
02:05
community I dare you to do the people
02:08
complaining the most are driving to the
02:10
protests and their Mercedes you can only
02:12
kick a dog so many times and pretty soon
02:14
he's gonna turn around and bite you we
02:17
have a lot of people telling us that the
02:19
land is more important than the - we
02:29
need more production more efficiency
02:31
more incentives and that means building
02:33
a new generation of safe clean nuclear
02:35
power plants in this country yeah
02:37
telling you the truth I'm really
02:40
disgusted and I'm against this milk
02:57
I guess initially going into the film I
03:03
probably felt that the mill was a bad
03:06
idea like why would anyone want to usher
03:08
back in an industry that had obviously
03:10
shortened people's lives and had created
03:13
a lot of environmental havoc in the area
03:16
so I was I was going to do the film in
03:19
this community looking at the pros and
03:20
cons within that community but what I
03:22
found which surprised me is that the in
03:25
that region almost everyone was
03:27
unanimously for this uranium mill so I
03:31
really wanted the film to look from a
03:33
very human perspective why that would be
03:36
why people would usher back in this
03:38
industry excited and hopeful that in six
03:43
to eight months we're gonna start seeing
03:45
or trucks rolling through the town we're
03:48
gonna see the mining picking up and
03:50
we're gonna see the milling moving
03:51
forward the Townsend net Arena nuclear
03:54
are located in the West in the Montrose
04:21
and we're gonna bring that to reality
04:33
uranium has been a huge economic boom to
04:38
this whole area these small communities
04:40
never had it as good as when there was
04:44
uranium mining and I do know that when
04:48
you're struggling to put your kids
04:50
through college put food on the table
04:52
some of these arenas look very very
04:56
appealing
04:58
and I cannot say that if I was in that
05:01
boat that I wouldn't be right there
05:03
swimming the same stream is it worth it
05:05
to open more minds and more Mills to me
05:09
it is it's an issue we all face not just
05:13
me or the miners it's an issue that we
05:15
all face because we do not give up our
05:19
consumption of fossil fuels and so
05:23
where's where it's gonna lead I'm just a
05:27
cowgirl I don't know after spending some
05:29
time in this community I really
05:31
empathize with their position they first
05:36
of all they have a very strong sense of
05:38
community and a place and I feel if you
05:41
are from some of these smaller towns in
05:45
America where community is so important
05:48
you don't want to lose that you don't
05:50
you know people just say just pick up
05:51
and go to a city lake go somewhere else
05:53
and they're just there say no you know
05:55
we love it here we've been here for
05:56
generations I think it started out for
06:00
me that I thought it would be a more of
06:01
an environmental film and very early on
06:03
I thought this is much more a story
06:07
about rural America and about economy
06:10
and how it's really unfair when if
06:14
someone's in a state of desperation
06:15
where they feel that they have to pit
06:18
job against health and environment
06:22
that's that's like the expression of you
06:24
know being between a rock and a hard
06:25
place that's just not a fair place to be
06:29
five years we've been trying to keep our
06:32
doors open thinking any day now those
06:35
jobs are gonna be here
06:36
these are the only people that have come
06:38
in and offered us jobs if any of the
06:40
people here who are against it had come
06:42
in and said they had jobs to match it
06:44
we'd be behind that too but right now
06:46
this is all we've got and I just want
06:49
the people here to remember that they're
06:51
keeping 1200 people from surviving and
06:53
that's really all I wanted to know is
06:54
that every one of you that has stood up
06:56
against this could have brought in jobs
06:58
for us and you didn't get five years so
07:02
please remember that when you guys make
07:03
this decision we're waiting and we've
07:05
been waiting a long time thank you
07:08
the film also has issue it strikes on
07:11
issues of classism as well because
07:13
Telluride which is one of their closest
07:14
neighbors is a very wealthy ski town and
07:17
I really felt that it's also looking at
07:20
the issue of you can be an
07:22
environmentalist if you can afford to be
07:24
an environmentalist so obviously the
07:26
people entirely can't afford to be
07:28
concerned about their environment and
07:30
and they are and not a good or a bad
07:33
thing not a judgment but the people in
07:36
nuclear and a dorito were extremely
07:37
frustrated because they felt like
07:39
Telluride and the opposition to the mill
07:42
was really slowing down the process in
07:44
getting the mill belt energy fuels and
07:50
the mill will happen because they have
07:53
worked diligently and making that
07:56
process the process has had a little bit
07:59
of extra help from some of those people
08:00
they have kept you smell held up a long
08:03
time and there's not a job that doesn't
08:05
have a degree there's more people killed
08:07
in skiing accidents mining accidents by
08:14
miners and tell your head start as a
08:16
mining community that got taken over my
08:17
hippy thank you I think the biggest
08:22
thing that I have found is it's not that
08:24
they don't care it's just they don't
08:26
understand yeah you know we've always
08:28
done a good neighbor and I think in
08:31
return that's what we're asking them to
08:33
do is be a good neighbor come down and
08:35
understand us don't just try to save us
08:37
because we don't need to be saved we
08:41
understand the regulations we understand
08:43
the problems
08:44
and we're willing to work through them
08:47
hopefully audiences will take will just
08:53
enjoy something being balanced because
08:56
the film it really is balanced and
08:58
looking at at both sides the Cotter
09:02
uranium mill is about two miles uphill
09:06
from the Arkansas River that flows
09:09
through our community I live a mile and
09:12
a quarter from the mill and so I have
09:15
two wells that were contaminated by the
09:18
Cotter uranium mill there are about a
09:21
hundred and twenty five wells that were
09:24
contaminated from Cotter nobody told us
09:28
in all those eight years that the well
09:31
was contaminated we tested our well when
09:34
we first bought the property we went to
09:36
the County Extension office and they
09:38
gave us the bottles and told us what
09:41
company to send it to but they failed to
09:43
tell us the really important thing hey
09:46
have it tested for radionuclides and
09:49
heavy metals I do not believe that it is
09:53
okay for a company in order to make
09:56
profit to pollute people against their
10:00
will I've heard energy fuel officials
10:03
stand up in front of big crowds and say
10:06
oh that's all from the past it's all
10:09
gonna be different now we have better
10:11
regulations you know what you can look
10:14
at what has been happening right here
10:16
this year last month last year the year
10:19
before and you can see exactly how they
10:23
will regulate that mill
10:29
the claim that nuclear energy is
10:32
environmentally green is just simply a
10:35
myth because they're only looking at the
10:38
carbon dioxide released at the reactor
10:40
itself our country has just been
10:42
bamboozled with this for them to
10:46
consider building new mills and creating
10:49
new spots like this this really I think
10:52
emphasizes the hidden costs that the
10:56
people in the country never see that
10:58
have to do with nuclear energy
11:10
rather be out mining and harvesting
11:12
Tomatoes frustration doesn't even come
11:16
close to describing how we feel about
11:18
our lives and our choices being taken
11:21
away from us when you've been out of
11:23
work your unemployment's running out
11:25
your savings is gone your wife and your
11:28
kids are gone people are getting very
11:30
very angry if the economy falters
11:35
anymore if people don't realize that
11:39
nuclear is our best option
11:42
tell your I keeps fighting us tooth and
11:44
nail it might not happen period and I
11:47
really hope I'm wrong my hope for the
11:49
film is that audiences who see the film
11:52
understand that it's really not a simple
11:55
issue when when we're talking about
11:57
things like the big picture of energy
12:00
this is a very small microcosm example
12:03
of people and lives that are affected by
12:07
our energy policy which especially as
12:12
Americans use more and more energy more
12:14
than Europeans more obviously than the
12:17
rest of the world and yet we don't seem
12:21
to have a very clear understanding of
12:24
how we are supposed to keep supplying
12:26
that energy attention needs to be made
12:29
to our our energy needs and and policies
12:35
across the Atlantic in South Africa
12:37
plans to put an open coal pit mine next
12:40
to a white rhino reserve with the health
12:43
and welfare of both rhinos and local
12:45
people at risk
12:47
Jeff Barbie reports poaching has become
12:51
a crisis the number of Rhino killed for
12:54
their horn has gone from 13 in 2007 to
12:58
over a thousand in 2013 alone but a new
13:02
danger to the park may be even more
13:04
disastrous than the widespread poaching
13:06
problem in the country
13:08
a new opencast coal mine on the southern
13:11
border of the park threatens this
13:14
Africa's most important rhino breeding
13:17
ground park officials here worry that
13:20
this new danger could be a deep dark
13:22
hole for rhino conservation because the
13:25
mine will pollute the air with dangerous
13:27
gases like toluene and benzene and blow
13:30
toxic coal dust over this wilderness
13:32
area the mine will also discharge acid
13:36
mine water laced with sulfuric acid and
13:38
radioactive byproducts into the oomphel
13:41
ozzie river where the parks animals in
13:43
the livestock of the surrounding
13:45
community all drink and when we come
13:48
here we come here to condo flat to
13:50
unwind and experience the world and now
13:53
there is a mine happening on the edge of
13:56
the wilderness and it's diluting the
13:58
every experience that Tibet the people
14:01
are getting here if hundreds of rhinos
14:04
are killed for their horn the population
14:06
can be reestablished as long as enough
14:09
are saved but if the park is polluted
14:11
with toxic mine waste this last refuge
14:14
of the Rhino will be lost forever where
14:17
our concern lies is with respect to dust
14:20
because there's no analysis of the dust
14:23
in terms of the toxic components within
14:27
that dust given the coal mining and the
14:30
blasting and and that sort of thing now
14:33
you can feel this wind this wind is
14:36
blowing across us right into the game
14:38
reserve
14:38
so they mined here this southeasterly
14:42
wind will carry the dust and the fallout
14:45
for being in the pot in the wilderness
14:47
area if it goes ahead the coal mine will
14:51
be right against the boundary fence of
14:53
the park this community of 1,200 people
14:55
will be forcibly relocated off the land
14:59
another coal mine opened in 2007 ten
15:03
kilometers away from the village and
15:04
people here already fall sick for
15:07
breathing the toxic dust and lions are
15:11
born in Appalachia like all Americans
15:13
other one there are my any mine
15:16
- boola boola trophy got lost
15:21
Abin efficacy with Ibaka tagalog this is
15:28
an aerial view of the older mine which
15:30
the in Dunas nephew says is already
15:32
causing their cattle to die we are also
15:34
feeling the consequences of them
15:37
allowing that mind there we've already a
15:41
witness some of our cows dying in the
15:44
past yeah I'm talking about from June
15:46
last year till now I myself have lost
15:49
about 18 of them to have so many fall
15:53
ill and died means that the rhinos and
15:56
other animals next door in the park who
15:58
drink the same water are also in danger
16:01
in rural Africa cows are the real wealth
16:04
like living walking bank accounts to pay
16:08
for a child's education and demand a
16:10
would sell a few cows but now that is
16:13
out of the question
16:14
this is a small community right on the
16:17
edge of in Filosa Park and the community
16:19
experiences a lot of benefits from the
16:22
park itself and they are very concerned
16:24
about what's going to happen if the mind
16:26
goes in just next to the park and right
16:29
within their community and we are right
16:32
next to that Game Preserve and by us
16:34
allowing the mind to take over this land
16:37
eeeh and then it will mean those animals
16:40
in the game reserve will end up
16:43
suffering because of the pollution the
16:46
dangers of having a mind right on the
16:48
border of the park is not lost to Roger
16:50
Porter he's the former head of
16:52
conservation and planning at the parks
16:54
administration and he agrees with in
16:57
demanding that the mine could not only
16:59
threaten the animals but could make
17:01
poaching worse the whole security issue
17:05
has not been addressed minds tend to be
17:08
a magnet drawing in people from
17:11
surrounding areas because of the
17:13
potential opportunity of jobs
17:16
universally it's well known that levels
17:20
of crime increase around mines so
17:23
poaching is a crime according to dr.
17:26
player if the mine and the poaching are
17:28
not stopped the whole web of life that
17:31
has been protected here for over a
17:33
century will
17:35
there's no doubt in my mind that if that
17:39
man went ahead it would destroy them in
17:46
a press statement
17:47
Ebru to cole who declined to comment on
17:49
this story touted jobs as a major
17:52
benefit to the local economy when the
17:54
mine comes in but according to the
17:56
community the mine has not consulted
17:59
them or even told them where they will
18:01
be forced to relocate to for more than a
18:05
hundred years the who flew Ian Pelosi
18:07
Park has been a sanctuary for rhinos and
18:10
many other endangered animals it is a
18:13
place that inspires visitors communities
18:16
and conservationists all over the world
18:19
to lose this area in a coal mining
18:22
operation is unacceptable to dr. Player
18:24
the people we're saying it's impossible
18:27
you can't you can't defeat these big
18:30
mining companies and we said no you can
18:33
but you got to know is what you are
18:36
doing is absolutely right if you know
18:39
that there is strategy and techniques
