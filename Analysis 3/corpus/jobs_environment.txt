https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9psw0anPHio
bill that will be introduced this week
00:01
by state Republicans is poised to spark
00:03
some controversy because this bill would
00:05
relax Wisconsin's mining regulations
00:07
supporters say it will create jobs while
00:10
opponents argue it hurts the environment
00:12
only News 3's Theo Keith explains the
00:15
bill mining supporters say work like
00:17
this could come to Northern Wisconsin's
00:19
iron county true to its name there's a
00:21
lot of iron there there are not enough
00:23
jobs and a county unemployment rate far
00:25
higher than the state average we're just
00:27
excited to see this bill being
00:29
introduced Republican Assemblyman Tom
00:31
Tiffany represents part of northern
00:32
Wisconsin he says all that iron will
00:35
create jobs the company Gogebic Taconite
00:37
wants to mine iron county but it wants
00:39
regulations loosened first my only
00:42
frustration is people that are close
00:43
minded and they've just had a knee-jerk
00:46
reaction that they say absolutely not
00:48
never tiffany is a co-sponsor of
00:50
legislation Republicans plan to
00:52
introduce Thursday in the assembly he
00:54
says Gogebic will create two or three
00:56
thousand jobs to build the mine and keep
00:58
700 more there permanently to run it I
01:00
think you're also going to see
01:02
significant employment from spin-off
01:03
industries as a result of the mine I
01:06
mean this is this is one of the biggest
01:07
economic development projects will see
01:10
in the history of Wisconsin we really
01:11
don't think that Wisconsin's mining laws
01:13
should be changed for the benefit of one
01:16
out of state mining company clean
01:18
Wisconsin's amber Meyer Smith says she's
01:20
not opposed to new jobs but she says at
01:22
what cost she says Wisconsin's
01:25
regulations are there to maintain the
01:27
beauty at the North Woods yes Wisconsin
01:29
needs jobs and I'm in the North Woods
01:30
especially needs jobs but they also need
01:33
clean drinking water and they need clean
01:35
air to breathe or it's going to comment
01:37
and expense it's just not worth it the
01:39
GOP says it's considering environmental
01:41
concerns companies will still face
01:43
regulations Assemblyman Tiffany says and
01:46
he says his bill has the support of
01:48
Republicans and Democrats in Iron County
01:50
