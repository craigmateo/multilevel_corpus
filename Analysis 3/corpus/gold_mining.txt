The Devastating Effects Of Gold Mining
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq0p5tnFnWs
Gold is one of the most precious metals
00:01
in the world and has run the gamut from
00:03
its uses currency to jewelry and even
00:05
electronic plating and infrared
00:07
shielding but for many people to cost
00:09
far outweighs its intrinsic value seeker
00:12
stories went to South America to learn
00:14
about some of the worst exploitation
00:16
both human and environmental gold is
00:20
maybe the most universal shorthand there
00:23
is for value and for greed the ancient
00:26
Egyptians were obsessed with it
00:28
European explorers marauded through
00:30
South America in search of it in
00:32
American cities like San Francisco and
00:34
Seattle rose to prominence because of it
00:36
it's a big part of our history as humans
00:40
looking at all that our obsession with
00:42
gold also seems historical sort of
00:45
old-timey but that's not at all true
00:47
there's still huge demand for gold today
00:50
the recession of 2008 helped gold
00:53
quadruple and value and a full half of
00:56
all the gold mined in the world has been
00:58
mined in the past 50 years alone but
01:01
what is different about gold today is
01:04
how we get it what happens in gold
01:09
producing areas is not what we imagine
01:12
where somebody's in a cave using a
01:13
chisel and a hammer to get these big
01:15
gold nuggets that's Diego cupolo a
01:19
photojournalist who spend some time in
01:21
Cajamarca Peru near a modern gold mine
01:23
actually not just any gold mine the
01:26
largest in all of Latin America and
01:28
modern mining looks very different than
01:31
it used to
01:33
most of the gold that we are mining now
01:35
comes in the form of little specks of
01:37
sand little flakes mixed in with dirt so
01:40
basically a lot of these companies are
01:42
using open pit mines to grab as much
01:46
dirt as possible and then they process
01:48
it with different chemicals including
01:50
cyanide mercury arsenic basically a
01:53
laundry list of all the things you want
01:55
to keep far away from evil but the
01:58
mining process creates a lot of waste
01:59
water laced with those pollutants and up
02:02
in the Andes Mountains the water doesn't
02:04
stay put when you take mine operations
02:08
and you put it on top of a mountain the
02:10
water as we all know only follows
02:13
gravity it goes down in every direction
02:18
and therein lies the problem
02:23
according to Diego poisoned water has
02:25
seeped throughout the region causing
02:27
stomach cancer in people illnesses and
02:30
livestock and decimated fish populations
02:32
and the people of cajamarca were
02:35
promised new wealth from the mining
02:37
economy haven't all seen a benefit they
02:40
see water that is contaminated and
02:42
economic opportunities that haven't
02:44
really changed for them quality of life
02:47
has remained the same for many of these
02:48
people without any of the profits that
02:51
you assume a gold mine would bring to a
02:53
region and so the people have done the
02:56
one thing that they're able to do about
02:58
the mines protest
03:01
they're pushing back against foreign
03:04
corporate influence ruined Natural
03:06
Resources and a history that somehow has
03:09
never seemed to change for them they've
03:11
been exploited for about five hundred
03:13
years now ever since the Spanish arrived
03:15
and started taking the Incas gold but
03:17
the same story happens wherever you have
03:19
resource extraction projects it's a
03:21
dirty industry which makes private
03:24
profits and public disasters for Diego
03:27
it all comes back to the value of gold
03:29
as expensive as gold e is right now
03:32
after visiting cajamarca Diego sees it
03:34
as undervalued dangerously so I realized
03:39
that gold is cheap because we pay
03:41
through it through the lives of people
03:43
who live in gold producing areas through
03:45
the lives of people that live in
03:46

sustainable energy with an unexpected
04:03
resource environmentally is for
04:06
deforestation the leading cause of
04:07
deforestation is for food production
04:10
with algae producing 40 times more per
04:12
acre that means we plant a thousand
04:15
acres of algae that's 40 thousand acres
04:17
of crops that don't need to be planted
